This file contains the details of recent difmap changes.
Changes are listed from the most recent to the oldest. Dates are
formatted as mm/dd/yy.

03/17/2010 version.h

           Changed the version to 2.4l.

03/17/2010 configure

           Changed the default fortran compiler of the linux-i486-gcc
           configuration option, to gfortran.

03/17/2010 recio.c

           Olaf Wucknitz reported that on a RAID array that he was
           using, the stdio buffer size that glibc adopted, was 5MB.
           Thus at each of the many fseek() calls that the recio
           facility performs, the C library had to discard existing
           buffered data and refill its buffers, by reading 5MB of new
           data from disk. In cases where only a small fraction of
           this data was subsequently read by the recio facility,
           before the next fseek(), this made difmap run extremely
           slowly.  Turning off stdio buffering in the recio facility
           recovered the original speed.

           I have thus turned off stdio buffering of files that are
           managed by the record-I/O facility.  This facility is
           usually used to either read large blocks of data per read,
           or to read small sections of widely separated large
           records. Neither of these use cases generally benefits from
           stdio buffering. So this patch should not have any adverse
           affects.

02/27/2008 version.h fits_src/sysfits.h configure

           Added support for Intel Macs. This is selected by specifying
           the argument, intel-osx-gcc to the configure script. The
           configuration has to differ from the apple-osx-gcc version,
           because the byte order is different between the PPC and intel
           Macs, and this effects how FITS datatypes are converted to the
           native floating-point and integer formats.

           Incremented the version number to 2.4k

06/16/2007 version.h

           Incremented the version number to 2.4j

06/16/2007 telspec.c antenna_names.hlp

           NRAO has started to use antenna names that have spaces in
           them, and this conflicts with the use of spaces as antenna
           name separators in difmap. To allow telescope names that have
           spaces, or other special characters, to be specified, it is
           now possible to escape such characters with a backslash. Since
           the shell also interprets backslashes, it is necessary to use
           two when specifying names on the command line.

10/20/2006 version.h

           Incremented the version number to 2.4i.

10/20/2006 uvrange.c

           On Intel processors, performing the same floating point
           operation with identical operands, in two different
           functions, often returns values that differ by a tiny
           amount. Although the difference is always below the
           advertized precision of a float, it can be enough to cause
           a comparison between the two numbers to fail. Since difmap
           selects visibilities by comparing their UV radii against
           the specified UV range, this meant that some functions
           selected different numbers of visibilities than others,
           sometimes including and sometimes excluding visibilities
           that lay right at the inner or outer edges of the UV
           range. Comparing the difference between two UV radii, to a
           specified precision, doesn't help if the radii of two
           visibilities straddling the edge of the range, are
           separated by this precision. However, this is unlikely in
           practice, provided that the tiny theoretical machine
           precision is used, and I can't think of any other solution.
           So when computing UV ranges from the data, the maximum UV
           radius is recorded after incrementing it by the theoretical
           floating point precision that corresponds to its magnitude,
           and similarly, the minimum UV radius is recorded
           decremented by the floating point precision that
           corresponds to the magnitude of the minimum.

10/20/2006 spectra.c uvrange.c visflags.c uvinvert.c

           In the above files, the comparison against the UV range and
           actual UV radii, was being done by comparing the squares of
           the radii, to avoid the overhead of a sqrt(). To ensure that
           all procedures are consistent in this comparison, I have
           modified all of the code to compare the actual radii.

09/21/2006 version.h

           Incremented the version number to 2.4h.

09/21/2006 difmap.c visstats.c visstats.h help/uv_to_wav.hlp
           help/wav_to_uv.hlp help/map_to_rad.hlp help/rad_to_map.hlp
           help/mapsize.hlp

           The statistics of the U and V coordinate magnitudes and UV
           radii of visibilities can now be queried using the vis_stats()
           function.

           Image plane coordinates can now be converted between the
           currently selected map units and radians, using the new
           map_to_rad() and rad_to_map() functions.

           UV plane coordinates can now be converted between the
           currently selected UV-plane units and wavelengths, using
           the new uv_to_wav() and wav_to_uv() functions.

06/30/2005 logio_src/print.c

           Difmap didn't work when compiled with gcc-3.3 and up, on
           AMD64 machines. This is due to a bug in gcc on that system,
           regarding the implementation of the va_list data-type.

           Whether this is a bug or a valid feature in gcc, appears to
           be contraversial among gcc developers, but the claim is
           that regardless, it is unfixable, due to the way that
           arguments are passed on the AMD64. The problem is that if
           one has a function that takes an already initialized
           va_list argument, and wants to delegate the processing of
           individual arguments to lower level functions, there is now
           no portable way to pass the va_list list to the lower level
           functions, in a way that lets them advance the
           list. According to Plauger's book, "The standard C
           library", the portable way to do this is to pass a pointer
           to the va_list argument, into the lower-level functions,
           but this doesn't work under gcc-3.3 and up on AMD64
           systems.

           The recommended workaround when compiling with gcc seems to
           be to make a copy of the va_list argument, using the
           va_copy() macro, and pass a pointer to that copy, instead
           of to the original va_list argument of the
           function. However va_copy() isn't part of the C standard,
           and thus isn't portable.

           Thus, since gcc has now broken the only way to delegate the
           processing of individual arguments of a variable argument
           list to lower-level functions, my workaround was to move
           the processing from those functions into the top-level
           print_format() function.

           Updated the version number to 2.4g.

06/29/2005 libtecla_src/config.sub libtecla_src/config.guess version.h
           README

           The autoconf config.sub and config.guess scripts, used by
           libtecla, were too old to know about amd64. I have thus
           updated them to those of autoconf-2.58, by upgrading from
           libtecla-1.5.1 to libtecla-1.6.1.

           Updated the version number to 2.4f.

02/13/2004 difmap.c version.h README

           The imstat command now allows one to query the mapsize
           in pixels, nx, ny, image-plane pixel cellsize dx, dy,
           and UV-plane pixel cellsize du, dv.

           Updated the version number to 2.4e.

01/07/2004 version.h README
 
           Updated the version number to 2.4d.

01/07/2004 configure fits_src/sysfits.h libtecla_src/*
           difmap_src/{maplot.c,minmax.c,plbeam.c,vlbmath.h,vplot.c}

           Ported to Mac OS X. You will first need to install pgplot
           and g77, and the configure script requires the argument
           apple-osx-gcc.

           Apple uses the same datatypes as big-endian machines like
           sparc, so the corresponding type definitions are now
           selected for Mac OS X in sysfits.h.

           There was a symbol clash between difmap's internal fmin() and
           fmax() functions, and identically named functions in a MacOS X
           system header, so the changes to the above files in difmap_src
           were all to change instances of these function names to
           floatmin() and floatmax(), respectively.

09/29/2003 uvf_read.c

           Abort bin_uvdata() if no visibilities are found in the
           file.

06/24/2003 hms.c

           The mark_ra command failed treated a number in which the
           first component of the RA string was -00, as a positive
           number.

06/04/2003 chlist.c

           The function which compares two channel selections was
           unfortunately comparing the first of the selections to
           itself, rather than to the second selection. As a result,
           in multi-model mode, if multiple models of equal
           polarization and number of channel ranges hashed to the
           same hash-table bin, the second was interpretted as being
           an update of the first, even though if its channel
           selection didn't match.

11/18/2002 fits_src/sysfits.h fits_src/fitkey.h fits_src/phdu.c
           configure

           Added configuration from CITA for compiling the fits
           library on 64-bit IBM computers running AIX. Unfortunately
           using this revealed a bug. At some point I had changed the
           ival member of Fitkey structures from an int to a long,
           worrying that int might be too small to record all possible
           integer header-keyword values on computers with 16 bits.
           However everything else continued to assume that this was
           an int, including my architecture dependent type conversion
           code. This didn't cause any problems on computers where int
           and long were the same size, and so remained hidden for a
           long time. I have changed the member back to an int, and
           all is well again.

08/01/2002 sphere_src/lex.c

           Script file openings and closings are now recorded in the
           log file.

07/31/2002 pager_src/pager.c

           If the user didn't have the PAGER shell variable set, the
           default pager command was incorrectly set to the string
           "PAGER", instead of to the value of the macro of this
           name. As a result, users got an error complaining about
           the non-existence of a command called PAGER. Now fixed.

07/31/2002 func.c

           Added an 'error' command. This prints an error message,
           then returns -1 to abort the current script.

07/31/2002 lex.c

           Difmap preprocessor directives can now use .* to specify
           the end of the range of arguments to be substituted should
           correspond to the last argument. Thus %,3.* now substitutes
           all arguments from argument 3 onwards, preceded by commas.
           Also added a %n directive, which substitutes the number of
           arguments available.

05/28/2002 modfit.c

           Modelfit now reports the number of degrees of freedom after
           each chi-squared, instead of just in the modelfit descriptive
           header. Tony needed this.

05/07/2002 sphere_src/lex.c

           I increased the number of pre-processor arguments allowed
           by difmap from 6 to 40.

05/02/2002 difmap.c mapmem.c maplot.c

           Pat needed to be able to get the RA/Dec location of the
           peak in her maps from a difmap script. The peak() function
           now allows one to query this.

03/02/2002 uvplot.c help/uvplot.hlp

           Added an option to not display the conjugate reflected
           visibilities. This is toggled with the '%' key.

02/28/2001 sphere_src/{matrix_blocks.c matrix_blocks.h iolib.c
                       makefile.distrib} help/read_table.hlp

           I added the new read_table user command. This reads
           tables of numbers from text files into 2D arrays, without
           the user having to tell difmap how many rows or columns
           there are.

01/06/2001 obedit.c obedit.h difmap.c

           Wrote edit_baselines() for use by the new flag and unflag
           difmap commands.

           Wrote flag and unflag difmap commands. These commands
           provide for scripted editing, instead of all editing having
           to be done graphically.

01/06/2001 hms.c vlbutil.h difmap.c

           Changed all functions to check for unexpected trailing
           characters when passed endp==NULL. Also changed
           read_sexagesimal() to return the read number via an
           argument, so that an error can be returned via the
           function return value. Updated all calls to
           read_sexagesimal() and parse_mjd() in difmap.c to
           take advantage of this.

01/06/2001 difmap_src/telspec.c

           When endp was passed as NULL, read_tspec() incorrectly
           rejected the "*" specification, complaining that garbage
           characters followed it. Now fixed.

12/18/2001 difmap_src/markerlist.h

           Whereas the sym argument of add_MarkerNode() was declared
           as a MarkerSymbol enumerator in markerlist.c, it was declared
           as an int in markerlist.c. Strangely, only Sun's cc compiler
           complained about this. Gnu's C compiler didn't even warn about
           it.

09/28/2001 difmap_src/difmap.c difmap_src/uvinvert.c difmap_src/vlbinv.h
           help/mapsize.hlp

           If the pixel size argument of the mapsize command is omitted,
           the maximum pixel size that can be accomodated without cutting
           off any visibilities is now substituted.

08/15/2001 difmap_src/uvf_read.c

           Treat the epoch as FK4 if < 1984, and FK5 if >= 1984.

07/09/2001 doc/makemanual

           Jim Lovell brought my attention to the fact that recent
           difmap command names that include underscores resulted in
           the makemanual script producing bad tex files. I have
           modified the script to escape these underscores, where
           needed.

07/09/2001 doc/makemanual, doc/model.tex, doc/smooth.tex,
           doc/fits.tex

           Changed \documenstyle to \documentclass to conform with
           latex 2e.

07/03/2001 configure difmap_src/makefile.distrib
           sphere_src/makefile.distrib difmap_src/difmap.c
           sphere_src/{iolib.c,plotlib.c,func.c,mathlib.c}

           Instead of setting the HELP_DIR macro via the standard C
           compiler -D flag, it is now placed in include/helpdir.h,
           which is included by all .c files that use the macro.  This
           file is only updated if configure finds that it needs
           updating, so the files that depend on it in the makefiles
           only get recompiled when the help directory actually
           changes. The advantages of switching to the new scheme are
           that the appropriate files get recompiled automatically if
           the help directory changes, and on some systems the escaped
           quotes used with -D caused problems when passed to
           compilers that were actually scripts, since the quotes got
           stripped too early.

06/27/2001 difmap_src/moddif.c

           Moddif now no longer objects when there are no visibilities
           in the selected stream and UV range.  This allows scripts
           to check if the number of is zero, before trying any
           commands that require that there be at least one visibility
           selected.

07/01/2001 recio_src/recio.c

           Greg Taylor reported problems using the select command on
           data from a large UV FITS file. Although recio.c contained
           special code to cope with files > 2GB, it didn't work. This
           was showing up on a 3.5GB scratch file. This bug has now
           been fixed.

05/03/2001 sphere_src/plotlib.c help/pgcont.hlp help/pggray.hlp

           I added user-commands to provide direct access to
           the pgcont() and pggray() subroutines.

02/09/2001 difmap_src/difmap.c  (Released difmap 2.4a)

           Svetlana Jorstad reported that if he typed
           "multi_model true" (before defining a map),
           this crashed difmap. This is now fixed.

02/08/2001 libtecla_src/

           The version of the tecla library used by difmap was updated.

02/05/2001 sphere_src/lex.c

           In searching for the start of a symbol to be tab completed,
           underscore wasn't being included in the list of characters
           allowed in a symbol. This has now been corrected

02/02/2001 libtecla_src/getline.c

           Some of the default key bindings are taken from the stty
           bindings set by the terminal. What I hadn't realized was
           that stty uses ASCII NUL (ie. 0 or ^@) to specify that
           a particular binding is unset. In a case where this
           occured, the tecla library comlained that the binding key
           was ambiguous, because this is also a string terminator,
           and the resulting empty string was thus the ambiguous
           prefix of all other bindings. Unset bindings are now
           ignored, as they should be. Note that you can use ^@ in
           textually specified binding sequences. It was just in the
           case of a binary control character that this was a problem.

02/02/2001 sphere_src/lex.c

           When performing file-completion, the '@' in @filename
           directives was being interpretted as part of the filename
           and thus preventing completion. Also if the filename
           was preceded by a comma separator, the comma and any
           non-space characters immediately before it, were also
           treated as part of the filename to be completed.
           This is now remedied.

02/02/2001 difmap_src/{uvradplt.c,corplt.c,vplot.c,uvplot.c,timplt.c}

           Added polarization labels to the titles of uvplot, corplot,
           vplot, uvplot and tplot.

01/31/2001 difmap_src/vplot.c

           Antonis noticed that when the model was displayed, the 'v'
           command didn't toggle whether flagged data were included or
           excluded from the autoscale range. While remedying this, I
           then noticed that when the flagged data wasn't selected to
           be displayed at all, the model for the flagged data was
           still displayed, and included in the autoscaling. Both of
           these problems have now been fixed.

01/23/2001 ./configure (re-released difmap version 2.4)

           Antonis Polatidis reported that under Suse Linux, -lcurses
           has to be changed to -lncurses when compiling the tecla
           library. I have thus moved the TECLA_LIB configuration
           parameter into the user-modifiable section and documented
           this.

01/19/2001 Released difmap version 2.4

01/06/2001 difmap_src/maplot.c

           In addition to what it used to display, the 'v' key now
           displays the Right Ascension and Declination of the
           selected position.

01/06/2001 difmap_src/uvf_write.c

           Noticed and fixed error handling bug in primdata().  If an
           I/O error were to occur while writing the random parameters
           of a given visibility, the error cleanup code would have
           free'd the group parameter buffer array twice.

01/03/2001 configure makeall libtecla_src/ sphere_src/{lex.c,sphere.c}

           Having been told by the free software foundation that I
           couldn't use the readline library in difmap, I replaced its
           previously optional support with optional support for my
           tecla terminal input library.  In the process I customized
           tab completion to complete words as difmap command or
           variable names when attempting completion on the first word
           of a logical line, reverting to filename completion later
           in the line.

11/09/2000 difmap_src/model.c

           In modifying the model component insertion code to cope with
           components with spectral indexes, I was setting the
           optimization flag which says whether a model is all continuum
           delta functions to the state of the last component inserted.
           Thus if one inserted a continuum delta function after an
           elliptical gaussian component, difmap wrongly thought that
           the model was completely comprised of delta functions.

10/08/2000 difmap_src/{chlist.c, subamphs.c, addamphs.c}

           Compiling difmap on linux revealed a few new compiler warnings.
           In chlist.c I was comparing the return value of ungetc() to
           NULL instead of EOF, and in subamphs.c and addamphs.c I wasn't
           including stdio.h (needed for a FILE * declaration in the
           included vlbutil.h).

10/01/2000 difmap_src/{modfit.c, moddif.c}

           When searching for visibilities within the current UV
           range, I was comparing the square of the UV radius of each
           visibility against the square of the min,max UV radii
           returned by uvrange(). Limited precision resulted in this
           rejecting a few borderline visibilities that shouldn't have
           been rejected. I have now changed the test to compare the
           UV radius instead of its square. The path to computing this
           thus matches that used in uvrange(), and so avoids the
           precision problem.

10/01/2000 difmap_src/{visstats.c, visstats.h, difmap.c} help/vis_stats.hlp

           I added a new command/function. When used as command,
           'vis_stats' displays the statistics of a specified
           observable to the terminal and to the log file. When used
           as a function, vis_stats() returns an array containing the
           various statistics of the specified observables. The
           choices of observables are the amplitude, phase, real and
           imaginary parts of the visibilities within the current UV
           range. The statistics computed are the mean, the error on
           the mean, the scatter around the mean, and the range of
           values.

09/22/2000 difmap_src/difmap.c

           The multi-model command switches models on enterring multi
           model mode, but it was neglecting to mark the map as out
           of date. I have remedied this.

08/27/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c markerlist.c markerlist.h mapplot.c
                       mapplot.h}
           help/{mark_xy.hlp mark_radec.hlp mapplot.hlp wmarkers.hlp
                 clear_markers.hlp delmarker.hlp}

           I added a marker/annotation facility to mapplot. Optionally
           annotated markers to draw on maps at specified equatorial
           or X,Y coordinates are specified via the new 'mark_radec'
           and 'mark_xy' commands. These add markers to a list,
           maintained by difmap.c, which is passed to subsequent
           invocations of mapplot.  Markers can be deleted wholesale
           with the 'clear_markers' command, or individually either
           interactive in mapplot with the 'u' command, or
           non-interactively with the delmarker command. Markers are
           saved by the 'save' command via the parameter file, which
           contains the commands needed to recreate the markers. The
           same commands can also be listed either to standard output,
           or a specified file via the 'wmarkers' command.

08/27/2000 difmap_src/{termstr.c vlbutil.h}

           I wrote write_string_arg(). This writes strings out in
           a form suitable for string arguments of difmap commands.
           This includes escaping special characters in the string,
           and enclosing the string in quotes.

08/27/2000 difmap_src/{hms.c vlbutil.h vlbhead.c mapplot.c difmap.c}

           I added a 'colon' boolean argument to sraddms() and sradhms()
           for specifying whether to separate sexagesimal components
           with a colon or a space.

08/27/2000 logio_src/logio.c

           The lputs() function, which up until now I haven't used,
           output a newline character after the specified text. This
           meant that it didn't emulate fputs() as it was designed to,
           so I removed the newline.

07/31/2000 difmap_src/model.c

           I updated model.c to use freelist.c for allocating both model
           components and model containers. Previously only model components
           were allocated in blocks, and this was done using code specific
           to this module. Allocating model containers from a freelist,
           makes it more efficient and safer to allocate lots of models.

08/30/2000 difmap_src/{maplot.c difmap.c}
           help/{mapplot.hlp polvec.hlp polarization.hlp}

           The first argument of the mapplot command can now be 'pmap'
           and 'pcln' (in addition to cln and map). Both result in
           polarization vectors being plotted over the map of the
           currently selected polarization, the first doing this for
           the residual map and the second for the restored maps. To
           take advantage of this the user must have previously used
           the multi_model command to select multi-model mode, and
           made maps of Q and U, in addition to the currently selected
           polarization. Difmap then uses the models that were made
           while mapping Q and U to remake these maps, store them
           temporarily in the beam array, compute the polarized
           intensity and angle maps, recording them in the unseen
           margins before and after the image in the map array
           (remember that the clean algorithm only correctly
           deconvolves the inner quarter of a map, so mapplot only
           displays this part). Mapplot then plots the inner quarter
           of the array as usual with grey-scale and/or contours, then
           overlays this with polarization vectors deduced from the
           polarization angle/intensity maps squirreled away in the
           hidden margins. Where to draw vectors and how long they
           should be for a given polarized flux is configured with
           the new 'polvec' command.

08/30/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c modeltab.c chlist.c obs.h chlist.h obutil.c
                       obs.c modeltab.h model.h}
           help/{multi_model.hlp read_models.hlp write_models.hlp
                 clear_models.hlp}

           I modified difmap to have the option of keeping separate
           models for different selections of channel-range and
           polarization. In this mode, requested with the new
           'multi_model' command, the 'select' command saves and
           recalls models for different selections. Thus when, for
           instance, one makes a map of U, then selects Q, and makes a
           map of Q, the model of U is reinstated when U is next
           selected.  The models are stored in a hash-table
           Observation::mtab, implemented in modeltab.c and indexed by
           channel range and polarization. Models can be saved to file
           using the new 'write_models' command, and restored from
           such files using the new 'read_models' command. They can be
           cleared using the new 'clear_models' command.

07/28/2000 difmap_src/{model.c model.h}

           I split out the model-component reader part of rmodel() into
           a new function called read_Modcmp(). This can be called by
           other functions when reading models embedded in other files.

07/27/2000 difmap_src/{units.c units.h}

           I wrote ordinal_suffix(), which returns the 2 character
           suffix to display after ordinal integers.

07/23/2000 difmap_src/difmap.c

           The first argument of mapplot (and maplot) is now a literal
           string, interpretted as an enumerator. Previously it was an
           array name. The only visible difference to users is that 
           they can now use the word 'clean' as well as the existing
           'cln' to request display of the clean map.

07/23/2000 difmap_src/{model.h model.c}

           I wrote cpy_Model() for allocating copies of models.

07/23/2000 difmap_src/{chlist.h chlist.c}

           a. I wrote cpy_Chlist() for allocating a copies of channel
              list objects.

           b. While doing this I noticed that the range-array reallocation
              in add_crange() was always allocating RANGE_INC elements
              instead of nrange + RANGE_INC. This would potentially have
              caused problems to people selecting more than 5 separate
              channel ranges with the 'select' command.

           c. I wrote eq_Chlist() for comparing channel-lists for
              equivalence.

07/21/2000 difmap_src/wmapbeam.c

           I now record the theoretically estimated RMS noise in the
           map FITS file, listed with a new NOISE keyword. Tim needed
           this for mosaicing. Note that this noise is that estimated
           from the weights, and will not be correct if these aren't
           the reciprocal of the visibility amplitude variance.

07/20/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c,hms.c,obutil.c,vlbutil.h,obs.h} help/shiftto.hlp

           I added shiftto command. This shifts the map center to
           a given RA,Dec position. To facilitate the entry of RA,
           Dec, I wrote hms.c::parse_sexagesimal_string(), and to
           facilitate the conversion of an RA,Dec change to the
           equivalent direction cosine shift, I wrote
           obutil.c::{radec_to_l(),radec_to_m()}.

07/12/2000 difmap_src/{vplot.c,vedit.c,vplot.h} help/vplot.hlp

           The vplot command now also provides the option of displaying
           GST along the X-axis of the plot. This is toggled with the
           'G' key.

07/10/2000 difmap_src/timplt.c help/tplot.hlp

           The tplot command now provides the option, toggled with the
           'G' key, of displaying greenwhich sidereal time along the
           X-axis instead of UTC.

06/20/2000 difmap_src/{model.c, model.h, modvis.c, addmod.c, modfit.c,
                       maplot.c, difmap.c, mapclean.c, mapres.c, mapres.h,
                       obs.h}
           help_src/modelfit.hlp

           I modified difmap to support model components with spectral
           indexes, including the ability to fit for the spectral
           index of each component. Frequency dependent fluxes are
           computed per IF, at the mean frequency of any spectral line
           channels within the IF.

05/22/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c, moddif.c, obs.h, slfcal.c}
           help/{uvstat.hlp, selfcal.hlp, uvrange.hlp, modelfit.hlp}

           The moddif() function and thus the user 'uvstat' function
           now take note of the limits set by the 'uvrange' command.
           I also improved the documentation of the uvrange command,
           including documenting its effects in the modelfit, uvstat,
           and selfcal commands.

05/07/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c, uvf_write.c, obs.h} help/wobs.c

           The 'wobs' command now has an optional boolean argument
           for requesting that any shifts applied by the 'shift'
           command be frozen into the output file.

05/07/2000 difmap_src/{difmap.c, obs.h, uvf_read.c, uvf_write.c, subarray.c,
                       obs.c, visaver.h, visaver.c}

           1. I have modified difmap to no longer discard unsampled
              antennas when reading in UV-FITS files. This was
              confusing to programs that operated on multiple files
              from the same instrument.
           2. Difmap now knows about the INTTIM random parameter (used
              to associate integration times with visibilities), and
              if found in the input file, writes them to the
              output files generated by the wobs command.

04/02/2000 difmap_src/uvradplt.c help/radplot.hlp

  Details: I added the ability to compute vector based statistics
           of the visibilities within a user selected region. The
           'V' key is used to initiate the selection. Note that
           there is also an equivalent scalar average based option
           initiated with the upper-case 'S' key. The latter has
           been in difmap for a few months, but I forgot to document
           it here.

03/21/2000 difmap_src/intrec.c

  Details: In ini_Intrec was advancing the integration pointer of the
           last subarray node one position too far while preparing for
           the next (in this case non-existent) iteration of the
           loop. As far as I know this hasn't ever caused any problems
           in difmap. I encountered it while trying out the electric
           fence memory debugging library.

03/01/2000 difmap_src/timplt.c difmap_src/difmap.c help/tplot.hlp

  Details: One can now toggle between small and large dot sizes.
           I have also added a tflags user variable so that the
           default plotting flags can be changed.

03/01/2000 difmap_src/uvplot.c difmap_src/difmap.c help/uvplot.hlp

  Details: I have also added a uflags user variable so that the
           default plotting flags can be changed.

03/01/2000 difmap_src/uvradplt.c

  Details: I fixed two bugs in the autoscaling of the error graph.
           When the amplitude graph was zoomed and the UV range
           was zoomed, but the error graph wasn't zoomed, autoscaling
           didn't occur in the error plot, resulting in pgplot error
           messages about the Y axis range of this graph being zero.

02/21/2000 sphere_src/lex.c

  Details: I fixed a bug that I had introduced when adding support
           for readline. Internal macros erroneously caused lexgets()
           to try to read from a NULL stream.

01/15/2000 difmap_src/maplot.c

  Details: When interactively creating model components, mapplot was
           using the absolute value of the map flux at the center of
           the component. I have changed it to use this flux with
           its original sign. This is necessary for SZ and CMB
           observations. 

01/13/2000 configure sphere_src/{lex.c,makefile.distrib,sphere.h}
           difmap_src/makefile.distrib

  Details: I added optional support for the gnu readline library.

01/05/2000 difmap_src/newfft.c

  Details: On the reverse real fourier transform, newfft() used the
           wrong scale factor to renormalize the result. This
           feature hasn't ever been used in difmap, so it won't have
           caused any problems.

01/05/2000 difmap_src/modelfit.c difmap_src/slfcal.c difmap_src/slfcal.h
           help/modefit.hlp help/selfcal.hlp help/vplot.hlp uvrange.hlp

  Details: In addition to the invert command, the modelfit and selfcal
           commands now take account of the uv limits specified by the
           uvrange command.

01/05/2000 difmap_src/vplot.c difmap_src/vedit.c help/vplot.hlp

  Details: In addition to the amplitude and phase of the observed
           visibilities, vplot can now display the amplitude and
           and phase of the vector difference between the observed
           visibilities and the model visibilities. The two modes
           are toggled with the new '-' key.

01/05/2000 difmap_src/uvradplt.c difmap_src/uvrange.c
           help/radplot.hlp help/projplot.hlp

  Details: In addition to the amplitude and phase of the observed
           visibilities, radplot and projplot can now display the
           amplitude and and phase of the vector difference between
           the observed visibilities and the model visibilities. The
           two modes are toggled with the new '-' key.

           Radplot and projplot can now also display the statistical
           errors in a separate subplot below the amplitude and phase
           plots. This is toggled with the new 'E' key.

01/03/2000 difmap_src/addmod.c

  Details: In obvarmod(), if a tentative continuum model existed it
           wasn't converted to an established UV plane model. This
           would confuse modelfit, because it thus wouldn't include
           the continuum model in the fit. This will only have effected
           observations in which continuum subtraction was elected by
           the user.

01/03/2000 difmap_src/modfit.c

  Details: In getnext(), I was getting the next IF before processing the
           final visibility of the previous IF. Since the visibility
           containers are reused whenever a new IF is paged into difmap,
           this resulted in the wrong visibility being used for the
           last point of each IF, and when the reused visibility
           container contained a flagged visibility, it would terminate
           the latest fitting cycle before the remaining IFs had been
           seen. This is now fixed.

12/25/99 difmap_src/addmod.c

  Details: I found that when mergemod() was asked to move the established
           models to the associated tentative models, a typo meant that
           it didn't do this to the continuum model. Fortunately the
           following call to clrmod() in this function, ended up doing
           this anyway, so no harm was done. I have fixed the typo, so
           that it is done in the intended place.

10/20/99 difmap_src/uvradplt.c

  Details: I have added the capability to display the statistics of
           the visibilities within a user-selected rectangular
           region of the plot.

06/04/99 difmap_src/stnstr.c

  Details: I improved the way that difmap composes array-names for
           use in mapplot plot titles. I now use the array name
           given in some antenna tables, where present, unless the
           array name is VLBI or VLBA. In the latter case I fall
           back to using the customary list of antenna-name
           abbreviations. In the case of observations with multiple
           sub-arrays, when the names of neigboring sub-arrays are
           identical, the array name is only written once. This caters
           for sites like OVRO, where multiple configurations of the
           same array are recorded in each FITS file. Previously, this
           led to unaesthetic title strings like "mma mma mma mma".

06/03/99 difmap_src/obs.c difmap_src/obs.h difmap_src/subarray.c
         difmap_src/uvf_read.c difmap_src/uvf_write.c

  Details: It turns out that difmap has been not been taking account
           of the contents of the optional TIMSYS, DATUTC/IATUTC
           keywords in binary antenna tables when interpretting times.
           Instead it has been assuming that all times were IAT, as
           was the case before binary AN tables were introduced.
           Fortunately, given that absolute times are only used in
           difmap for plotting, this won't have done any harm to
           anybody's data. UV FITS files written by difmap contain
           times recorded in the original time system.

           Before fixing this problem I had a look through a lot of UV
           FITS files generated by other programs and discovered that
           in the vast majority of cases the DATUTC and IATUTC
           keywords were set to zero, regardless of the value of
           TIMSYS. In fact, in many files both DATUTC and IATUTC were
           present and set to zero. This makes no sense at all. In one
           file I even found DATUTC set to -26 when it should have
           been +26. Clearly these keywords can't be trusted, so I
           decided to do the following to find the correct value to
           substitute for DATUTC.

           If TIMSYS='IAT', or TIMSYS is unspecified and thus defaults
           to IAT, then use DATUTC if DATUTC is > 0, otherwise use
           IATUTC if IATUTC is > 0, otherwise compute the value of
           IAT-UTC that was in force at the reference date of the
           FITS file.

           If TIMSYS='UTC', complain if DATUTC != 0, then reset it
           to zero.

           If TIMSYS is anything else, use DATUTC, but emit a warning
           if DATUTC is zero or not present.

06/03/99 slalib_src/dat.c

  Details: I belatedly added an entry for the Jan 1 1999 leap second.

08/09/98 difmap_src/telspec.c

  Details: cpplot always displayed closure phases that were computed
           by traversing the three telescopes of the triangle in
           ascending order of telescope number. As a result if the
           telescopes were named in the opposite order the displayed
           closure phases had the wrong sign. The problem was in
           telspec.c::endtri() which was incorrectly designed to
           produce this behaviour. Thanks to
           zshen@hotaka.mtk.nao.ac.jp for reporting this bug.

03/22/98 version.h

  Details: Changed version to 2.3c (21 Mar 1998) in preparation for
           a general release.

03/22/98 sphere_src/func.c help/print.hlp

  Details: I have added a logical wrap_print_output variable to
           allow one to prevent the print command from wrapping its
           output when its output passes column 60. The default line
           wrapping made it difficult for users to parse the output
           of automatic mapping scripts that use the print command
           to display status messages etc.. The default remains to
           wrap lines, so wrap_print_output starts out set to true.

03/16/98 uvinvert.c invert.hlp mapsize.hlp

  Details: I have modified the invert command so that it no longer
           refuses to continue when faced with map pixels that are too
           large to Nyquist sample the currently selected UV
           range. Instead it simply ignores visibilities that can't be
           adequately sampled by the current map grid. It then tells
           the user what percentage were ignored and how to avoid
           ignoring any of them.

02/02/98 mapmem.h

  Details: I have changed the Bincell typedef from short to int. This
           is the datatype that is used to count visibilities within
           the uniform weighting grid. At present there are unlikely
           to be enough visibilities per grid cell that this would
           overflow, but as data-sets continue to get larger, it seemed
           prudent to increase it now, just in case. Difmap isn't used
           on any system where int < 32 bits, so there is no need to
           switch to long.

01/22/98 version.h

  Details: Changed version to 2.3b (22 Jan 1998)

01/22/98 difmap.c uvinvert.c

  Details: The uniform weighting bin width was being rounded to the
           integer before use. This meant that only integral bin
           widths could be selected. I have removed this uneseccary
           restriction. The only restriction now is that the minimum
           uniform weighting bin width is 1.0. Numbers > 0 but < 1 are
           rounded up to 1.0. A bin width of 0 selects natural
           weighting as before.

01/22/98 uvinvert.c

  Details: The computation of Nyquist sampling limits based on the
           chosen map pixel size wasn't taking the 2 pixel fuzz of the
           convolution mask into account. This is extremely unlikely
           to have caused any visible effects, but there is no reason
           not to correct it.

01/22/98 uvinvert.c

  Details: Ouch. The algorithm used for uniform weighting has a
           serious bug. I can't imagine how this escaped notice for so
           long. To save space, I coded the uniform weighting array of
           weights using just the positive U half of the full
           half-conjugate-symmetric array. This would have been ok if
           the correct method had been used to compute the conjugate
           indexes of points in the negative U part of the UV plane.
           Unfortunately, to do this, instead of negating both U and
           V I only negated the U coordinate.

           Note that this only effects the weighting step of uniformly
           weighted maps. All other maps are completely unaffected.

01/21/98 uvinvert.c

  Details: Visibilities marked out of range via the uvrange command
           weren't being rejected when computing uniform weights.

10/20/97 logio_src/logio.c

  Details: On error logio calls closelog() to close the log file.
           Unfortunately this caused an infinite recursion, because
           closelog() then tried to write a close-down message to the
           log file. I have now fixed this by adding an error-flag
           argument to the private closelog() function. When it is
           set, closelog() uses fprintf() in place of lprintf().

07/07/97 Released difmap version 2.3a (7 Jul 97)

06/17/97 uvf_read.c

  Details: Modified getanbin() to preserve both orbital (where
           available) and ground-based parameters for recording in
           output files, regardless of individual mount types. Also
           added a warning message for unknown MNTSTA values.

05/22/97 vlbhead.c obs.c wmapbeam.c uvf_write.c uvf_read.c obs.h

  Details: I modified difmap to recognize the optional OBSRA and OBSDEC
           keywords. If found, they are reproduced in any new UV, map
           and beam FITS files that are derived from the observation.
           The intention is to preserve information that is used
           to do mosaicing in other packages.

05/22/97 newfft.c uvinvert.c

  Details: Difmap's FFT algorithm contained a bug whereby one column
           of the half-conjugate-symmetric UV plane array was set to
           half its correct value. Fortunately the offending column
           was the column at which zero padding of the outer part of
           the uv plane starts, which is why this went unnoticed until
           the same FFT code was used in another program.
           Unfortunately there was also a bug in 'invert' that meant
           that the check for data that extended into the zero-padded
           region was 4 pixels too lenient, so some maps may have been
           slightly effected by this problem. To exhibit the bug
           a dataset would have to have strong visibility amplitudes
           right at the edge of the legal region of the UV plane
           established by the mapsize command. This isn't a common
           occurrence, so I am hopeful that no harm has been
           caused. Of the tests that I have done, no differences were
           encountered except in one case where I precisely tuned the
           parameters of the mapsize command to cause a strong
           visibility track to fall in the outermost column of the
           allowed region of the UV plane array.  The result was a map
           that looked identical, but had a peak flux that was
           incorrect in its third decimal place.

04/14/97 difmap_src/maplot.c difmap_src/color.c help/mapcolor.hlp

  Details: The definitions of brightness and contrast were flawed.
           I have re-implemented plcmap() to use more conventional
           definitions. In particular the color ramp now saturates,
           to the respective end of the color table at brightnesses
           of 0.0 and 1.0.

04/14/97 difmap_src/uvf_read.c

  Details: A free malloc debugging library pointed out a malloc
           problem in get_anrow(). 3 bytes too few were being
           requested when allocating an->antrow, due to a missing
           pair of parenthesis. Fortunately, this is unlikely to
           have caused any problems (most malloc's allocate
           in 8-byte blocks and all members of the offending array
           are 4-byte aligned).

03/31/97 difmap_src/{difmap.c,specplot.c}

  Details: I changed a few lingering fprintf's to lprintf's.

03/31/97 obs.h uvf_read.c uvf_write.c binan.c subarray.c vlbhead.c

  Details: Up until now Difmap was coded to reject data-sets from
           orbital antennas (Insufficient information). Now that
           VSOP has been launched I have added support for such
           stations. I added 'numorb' and 'orbpar[]' members to
           obs.h::Binan, and an 'orbparm[]' member to obs.h::Bintel.
           This required memory mangement changes to binan.c, and
           the addition of a numorb argument to new_Binan(). uvf_read.c
           and uvf_write.c had to be modified to read/write NUMORB
           and ORBPARM parameters. vlbhead.c had to be modified to
           output the details of orbital antennas. While doing this
           I encountered a bug in binan.c::fix_calpar(). This function
           isn't actually used by difmap, so no damage was done.

02/25/97 wmapbeam.c

  Details: LTESS in AIPS assumes that the third axis of an map
           file is always FREQ, whereas Difmap writes the STOKES
           axis as the third axis and the FREQ axis as the forth. The
           bug is in LTESS, not Difmap, but for the convenience of
           users of LTESS and possibly other broken AIPS tasks,
           I have modified Difmap to comply with what LTESS expects.

02/13/97 Packaged up difmap2.2d for Tony Readhead.

01/22/97 sphere_src/plotlib.c

  Details: pgslw was quietly limiting the line width to < 5. I increased
           the limit to 200, as does PGPLOT.

09/27/96 sphere_src/mathlib.c

  Details: Erik noticed an error in rms_fn(). I fixed it. This user
           function is not used by Difmap.

09/20/96 fits_src/phdu.c

  Details: There was a missing break statement in the case that
           handled reading CTYPEn keywords from FITS primary headers.
           This caused the following case to install the CTYPEn string
           value as the double value of the corresponding CRPIXn
           keyword. This resulted in garbled CRPIXn values in 
           Hat Creek UV FITS files. Presumably other observatories
           place CRPIX after CTYPE, or this would have shown up long
           ago.

           I also found the identical bug in the PTYPEn random parameter
           keyword, which would have caused PSCALn to be corrupted.

09/15/96 difmap_src/difmap.c difmap_src/vedit.c difmap_src/clplot.c
         difmap_src/visplot.h help/cpplot.hlp help/vplot.hlp
         difmap_src/specplot.h difmap_src/specplot.c help/specplot.hlp

  Details: I added command-line arguments to allow the user to specify
           the maximum number of pages to plot when plotting to a
           non-interactive device.

09/15/96 sphere_src/plotlib.c

  Details: When I recently added a pgend command to Difmap I forgot
           set plot_open to false. I have fixed this.

09/14/96 difmap_src/difmap.c difmap_src/uvradplt.c difmap_src/visplot.h
         help/projplot.hlp help/radplot.hlp

  Details: I added command-line arguments to allow the user to specify
           the min and max phases to be displayed.

09/14/96 sphere_src/plotlib.c

  Details: In a recent version of PGPLOT the interpretation of the
           signs of the nx and ny arguments became significant. I
           removed a sanity check that changed -ve nx and ny to 1.

08/28/96 difmap_src/intrec.c

  Details: If integrations from different sub-arrays were interleaved
           Difmap would crash with a segmentation violation.
           This was a bug in the sorted-list insertion code in
           sub_insert(). Fixed.

08/17/96 difmap_src/maplot.c

  Details: Changed maplot to cater for maps with negative peaks.
           Previously the reported peak was the maximum value in
           the map. Now it is the minimum or the maximum value
           depending upon which has the largest magnitude. This
           effects both the reported peak and percentage contour
           levels.

06/01/96 doc/model.tex

  Details: Added missing par_phi label.

05/21/96 doc/makemanual

  Details: makemanual didn't work on Alphas under OSF/1. This turned
           out to be because the Alpha uses an archaic version of awk.
           I re-wrote makemanual to only use the features of the
           original release of awk. In the process I converted the
           module listings into page-numbered indexes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Difmap 2.2c released (05/19/96)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

04/19/96 Packaged up difmap2.2c for Greg Taylor.

04/18/96 difmap.c vlbutils.h hms.c vlbhead.c maplot.c

  Details: Greg requested that I add two decimal places to the
           seconds fields of the RA and DEC that is recorded in
           model files. To do this I added a precision argument
           to sradhms() and sraddms(), set the number of
           decimal places requested in difmap.c::wmodel to 6.
           while retaining the number of decimal places used by other
           functions to the original value of 3.
 
03/29/96 sphere_src/lex.c

  Details: I added escape character handling for string arguments so
           that Eric could use tabs in fprint lines.

03/28/96 sphere_src/{userio.c,func.c} help/{prompt_user.hlp,general.idx}

  Details: I added a prompt_user() user-function for use in prompting
           a user for input.

02/17/96 difmap_src/addmod.c

  Details: gcc again warned about something that it hadn't before.
           This time it was an & character where a && had been
           intended. This was in clrmod(). Fortunately the & version
           gives identical results to the && version in this case,
           so it won't have caused any problems. I have fixed it
           anyway.

02/17/96 sphere_src/run.c

  Details: The latest version of gcc voiced its suspicion over what
           turned out to be a long-standing bug in the handling of
           string selection indexes. I had used a bitwise | instead
           of a logical ||. The impacted function is so obscure and
           un-advertized that I doubt that the bug has ever been
           invoked.

02/15/96 help/polarization.hlp

  Details: The listed equation for U was incorrect (the code is fine).

02/13/96 difmap_src/uvf_read.c

  Details: I modified get_date() such that if the date of the first
           group is invalid (before 4701 BC), it searches forward
           for the first group that does have a valid date and emits
           a warning. This caters for the rare problem of UV fits files
           that contain a corrupt (usually JD=0) initial date. Rachel
           had such a file. get_date() records the resulting start group
           index in fob->start_group. This is then used as the starting
           point in bin_uvdata(), so the first fob->start_count visibilities
           don't get read. This should really be extended to omit deleted
           visibilies, but that would take a lot more work.

02/08/96 Packaged up difmap2.2b for Nick Scoville.

01/30/96 difmap_src/plotlib.c help/pgerry.hlp help/pgerrx.hlp help/pgscf.hlp

  Details: Added pgscf() PGPLOT command.
           Updated pgerry and pgerrx commands to be more like their
           PGPLOT counterparts. Updated pgbox to not call pgpage().

01/23/96 difmap_src/vplot.c

  Details: The phase model did not take account of the phase
           zoom parameters. The phase data was zoomed correctly
           but not the model. Changed phase-model plot limits
           from (-pi,pi) to (vp->phsmin, vp->phsmax) in v_plmodel().

12/13/95 sphere_src/iolib.c

  Details: Jim Lovell pointed out a bug in outfile_fn(). The
           append and binary command-line flags were swapped.

12/11/95 Packaged up difmap2.2a for Greg Taylor.

12/08/95 configure fits_src/sysfits.h

  Details: Changed illegal linux-i468-gcc macro to linux_i486_gcc.
           The RS6000 C compiler was the first to notice this problem.

11/09/95 difmap_src/{hms.c,vlbutil.h}

  Details: Declination labels for negative declinations with
           0 as the degree field were erroneously shown as
           positive.

11/02/95 sphere_src/{run.c,help.c,sphere.c,sphere.h,compile.c}

  Details: Previously interface-language array dimensions were
           store in short ints. I changed this to longs so that
           larger arrays could be allocated.

10/12/95 difmap_src/difmap.c help/mapvalue.hlp

  Details: Added a new user-function which returns the value of
           the pixel nearest to a given map position.

10/12/95 mapmem.h mapmem.c

  Details: Added conversion functions to convert between
           center-relative map coordinates (radians) and map array
           2D pixel indexes. Also added a MapArea container to
           the MapBeam structure. In new_MapBeam this is initialized
           with the pixel bounds of the map area within the map array.

10/12/95 difmap.c

  Details: The addcmp command hadn't been modified to accept SZ
           components. Now fixed.

09/25/95 difmap_src/makefile.distrib

  Details: Corrected an obpol.o dependency list that cited obpol.c
           as a target where obpol.o should have been used. The
           effect of the makefile bug was a bus error in get_Obpol()
           after I added a new member to the Observation structure
           in obs.h.

09/25/95 obs.h obs.c addmod.c difmap.c uvinvert.c vlbinv.h

  Details: The uvzero command was poorly conceived and didn't even work
           as originally intended. I have added a new Observation::uvzero
           container which contains the user-specified zero-spacing flux,
           associated visibility weight and the current model amplitude
           at the origin of the UV plane. The functions in addmod.c now
           know to update the zero-spacing model amplitude along with
           other visibilities, and the uvzero command now takes a
           new visibility-weight argument.
           Previously a weight of 1 was assigned to the zero-spacing
           flux, which was then messed up in uvgrid(). There was no
           account taken for difference mapping at all.
           What remains to be done is to make other commands such as
           radplot, selfcal etc... use the zero-baseline flux. At
           present only the 'invert' command uses it.

08/29/95 difmap_src/obs.c

  Details: Obs_alloc() wasn't initialize the Obvel struct, so
           wobs tried to write ALTRVAL etc when it shouldn't have.
           Fixed.

08/24/95 difmap_src/difmap.c

  Details: If the fourth (docursor) command-line argument was
           provided, difmap dumped core. This was due to uvplt_fn()
           accessing invals[4] instead of invals[3]. Fixed.

07/15/95 fits_src/bhdu.c

  Details: Memory allocation bug detected and fixed by Peter Teuben:
           get_bdhu() neglected to allocate private copies of tform
           strings. Instead it simply used the static pointer returned
           by get_key(). This was later free()'d in del_bhdu(), which
           resulted in heap corruption under Linux (and probably on
           other systems). The fix was to change:

            field->tform = KEYSTR(key);

           To:

            field->tform = fitsstr(KEYSTR(key));

           With this fix Difmap now works under Linux. Unfortunately
           the Sun /usr/lib/debug/malloc.o debugging version of malloc
           failed to show up any problem. I now wonder how many other
           such problems may still exist.

07/13/95 configure fits/sysfits.h

  Details: Peter Teuben started the ball rolling for a Linux port.
           Linux port initiated by adding a linux-i486-gcc configuration
           option to the configuration script and adding a FITS datatype
           conversion case for linux in sysfits.h. Linux datatypes are
           little-endian IEEE, so Linux has to use the byte-swapping
           code from sysfits.c.

06/02/95 sphere_src/lex.c

  Details: Added the option to start a new interactive shell level.
           This is triggered when the @ operator is cited without
           a command-file name. The shell can be exit via the
           local End-Of-File character. This feature is useful
           for breaking out of a script temporarily.

05/24/95 specplot.c

  Details: sp_set_bgl() was returning NULL on a couple of error
           conditions instead of 1. gcc on Sunos didn't notice this
           but gcc on Solaris 2.4 did. The bug never manifested.

05/05/95 spectral_line.hlp

  Details: Added a clrmod statement to the example mapping loop.

05/02/95 spectra.c specplot.c specplot.hlp specsmooth.hlp

  Details: Added scalar averaging of phases (in addition to amplitudes).

04/30/95 addamphs.c subamphs.c modvis.c specplot.c

  Details: Minor change. My check for innapropriate arguments of
           atan2() was too pessimistic in addamphs(), subamphs() and
           s_getspec(). Now changed to check that both arguments are
           non-zero, rather than greater than an arbitrarily tiny
           absolute value. Similarly, modvis() checked whether the
           amplitude was non-zero before calling atan2(). I changed
           this to check the real and imaginary values directly.
           I haven't noticed any problems relating to the above.

04/30/95 obutil.c visaver.c

  Details: Realized that vector averaging can produce zero amplitudes,
           from non-zero visibilities. I have added checks to
           ob_select() and av_endint() to mark such cases as deleted.
           I haven't ever seen this case come up, but the potential is
           clearly there.

04/20/95 *

 Rational: Until now, selected channel ranges have applied equally to
           all IFs. This is useless for multi-IF spectral-line
           mapping. Now for channel specification purposes the IFs
           are treated as a contiguous set of channels so that
           different channels can be selected from each IF. This also
           means that one or more IFs can be completely omitted from
           the selection. Most of the following changes cater for such
           unsampled IFs. In order to do this I have had to stop
           guaranteeing that there is always an IF in memory.
           Functions that use IFs are now expected to request them,
           rather than assuming that a pertinent IF is already in
           memory. To further this I have discarded the getif command,
           added IF index arguments to the plotting commands and added
           key bindings to allow one to interactively flip between IFs
           in the plot commands. I have also replaced the OB_STREAM
           state with three states - OB_SELECT, OB_RAWIF and OB_GETIF
           to allow one to distinguish between just having a selection
           and having an IF of that selection in memory. OB_RAWIF is
           set on entry to iniIF() and only upgraded to OB_GETIF when
           all corrections have been applied.
  Details:
        addmod.c:
           Added many ob_ready(OB_INDEX) calls. Uses new nextIF()
           semantics. Now quietly ignores requests to modify model
           visibilities when no selection is in effect, the only
           exception being requests to clear the established model
           with clrmod().
        chlist.c:
           Added sub_Chlist() constructor.
        clplot.c:
           Added call to ob_ready(OB_SELECT). Added cif argument and
           initial getIF(). Added [] keys to step through IFs using
           nextIF() and getIF(). Added a new title line, and displayed
           the IF index along with the triangle specification. Bracket
           clsplot() code with get_cif_state() and set_cif_state().
           Changed default IF and channel editing modes to global.
           Added IF index argument to all ed_integ() calls.
        corplt.c:
           Catered for the new cif argument to clr_Telcor and ed_Telcor.
           Added call to ob_ready(OB_INDEX). Added cif argument to
           corplot() and new_Corpar(). Added [] keys to step through
           IFs using nextIF(). Added a new title line, and displayed
           the IF index along with the station name.
        difmap.c:
           shift_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX.
           unshift_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX.
           uncal_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX.
           winmod_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX.
           uvstat_fn(): Removed doall=1 argument of moddif().
           uvsel_fn(): Take account of new return value of ob_select().
           timpl_fn(): Added IF index argument.
           corpl_fn(): Added IF index argument. Now requires OB_INDEX.
           timpl_fn(): Now checks for OB_SELECT. Added IF index argument.
           vplot_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Added IF
            command-line argument.
           cpplt_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Added IF
            command-line argument. Swapped triangle-spec and nplot
            command-line args.
           resof_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Now sends
            doall=1 to resoff().
           unoff_fn(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX. Now sends
            doall=1 to clroff(). Changed "uncal:" message prefix to "clroff:".
           getif_fn(): Discarded.
           specso_fn():\
           specop_fn(): Changed return 0 to return no_error.
           specsm_fn():/
           specop_fn(): Removed nplot command-line argument.
           specpl_fn(): Added initial nplot command-line argument.
           wrtpars(): Checks for OB_SELECT instead of OB_STREAM before
            writing select command.
           Also changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT in all of: invert_fn
           clean_fn wmap_fn wbeam_fn wdmap_fn gscal_fn startmod_fn
           uvrad_fn self_fn uvplt_fn maplot_fn save_fn modfit_fn
           uvstat_fn uvprj_fn.
        dpage.c:
           dp_cal(): Unity is now substituted for amplitude
            corrections that are <= 0.0.
           dp_shift(): Modified to use the new IF frequency members.
        if.c:
           new_If: Added default initialization of If::(coff,cl,df,bw).
           del_IF: Added code to delete If::cl.
        maplot.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Modified to label with
           getfreq(all IFs), instead of ob->stream.freq.
        moddif.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Uses new nextIF() semantics.
           Removed doall argument. moddif() now always goes through
           all IFs. Bracketed code with get_cif_state() and
           set_cif_state().
        modfit.c:
          fituvmodel(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Bracketed
           code with get_cif_state() and set_cif_state() calls.
          endfit(): Modified to restore the originally selected IF.
          getnext(): Modified to use nextIF() and skip unsampled IFs.
           Also corrected bug which was causing it to process the last
           IF of multi-IF datasets twice, and the first IF not at all.
           Ouch!
          new_Modfit(): Modified to set mf->cif = -1 to tell getnext()
           to start by reading the first IF!
        nextif.c:
          Rewritten. nextIF() no longer defers IF indexes, but it now
           has a 'skip_empty' argument to optionally skip unsampled
           IFs, and a 'step' argument to specify the iteration
           direction.
        obedit.c:
          ed_integ(): Now requires at least OB_SELECT observation
           state. Added IF index argument. This replaces the current
           IF as the target of the selif flag. Now only apply edits to
           the visibilities in memory if the edit applies to their
           source IF. Added cache size limit to prevent edits from
           eating up too much memory.
          ed_flush(): Now requires OB_SELECT state if there are any edits
           to be flushed.
          ed_ifdata(): Changed to not edit unsampled IFs.
          ed_range(): When the selchan flag is set, ed_range() will
           now ignore the edit if there is no IF channel list, and
           otherwise use the IF channel list instead of ob->stream.cl
           to expand the channel range. Changed 'selif' check to
           compare the IF being processed against the edit node 'cif'
           index.
          dp_edit(): Realized that this function has been ignoring the
           selif flag and simply editing all IFs - Aaaarghh.
           Fortunately the fact that ed_range() got this right, meant
           that the problem was usually suppressed. It has taken me
           ages just to find a way to invoke it. Modified to honor the
           selif flag, and to ignore edits if the selchan flag is set
           when no channels are selected within the given IF, and to
           use the IF specific channel list instead of ob->stream.cl
           otherwise. Modified to use the cif index of the edit node
           with 'selif' instead of the current IF.
          ip_edit(): This had the same bug as dp_edit(). It didn't
           check selif, and could thus end up editing data that it
           shouldn't. As with dp_edit() this was a hard bug to invoke.
           Modified to use the cif index of the edit node with 'selif'
           instead of the current IF.
        obedit.h:
          Added Edint::cif IF index member to go with selif, instead
           of requiring the existence of a current IF.
        obpol.c:
          Now requires state >= OB_INDEX, instead of OB_DATA. When
           substituting a default polarization, now use
           ob_ready(OB_SELECT) instead of testing ob->state directly.
        obs.c:
          new_Observation(): Changed to take account of the new return
           type of ob_select().
          Obs_alloc(): Added initialization of Observation::nctotal
           member. Removed initialization of discarded
           ob->stream.(freq,bw). Removed initial assignment of a
           default stream channel list.
        obs.h:
          Added If::coff and If::cl members. Replaced IF::(chan_bw,
           sb, full_bw) with If::(df,bw), where df is the signed
           increment between channels, and bw is identical to full_bw.
           Added Observation::nctotal member (total number of selected
           channels) Split Obstate::OB_STREAM into OB_SELECT, OB_RAWIF
           and OB_GETIF. Removed UVstream::(freq,bw) - use getfreq()
           and getbw(). Added get_cif_state, set_cif_state, app_Telcor
           prototypes. Updated ob_select, resoff, clroff, ini_bcor,
           nextIF, ed_Telcor, adj_Telcor, clr_Telcor, moddif and
           ed_integ prototypes. Removed putIF, iniIF, recalib,
           name_Sideband, Sideband_name prototypes.
        obshift.c:
          uvmodshift(): Quietly ignore call if ob->state < OB_SELECT.
           Use new nextIF() semantics to avoid unsampled IFs.
           Bracketed code with calls to get_cif_state() and
           set_cif_state() calls.
          uvshift.c(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_RAWIF.
          obshift(): Now checks for OB_INDEX. Now only shifts
           visibilities in memory if ob->state >= OB_GETIF. Now only
           shifts model visibilities if ob->state >= OB_SELECT.
        obutil.c:
          getIF(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Susbstitute
           ip_clear() for ip_read() for unsampled IFs. Set
           ob->state=OB_SELECT to invalidate the previous IF. Removed
           initialization for discarded ob->stream.(freq,bw).
          iniIF(): Made static and removed israw argument. Set
           ob->state=OB_RAWIF on entry and ob->state=OB_GETIF on
           sucessful completion. Corrections not applied to unsampled
           IFs. Modified to call app_Telcor() (used to be recalib).
           Discarded name_Sideband() and Sideband_name().
          putIF(): Discarded.
          getmodel(): Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Do nothing If
           the model is already in memory. Sets ob->state=OB_SELECT
           before the new model visibilities overwrite those of the
           current IF.
          ob_select(): Now returns integer status rather than deleting
           the Observation. Changed to call new private
           ob_get_select() function to check and install the new
           channel list and polarization. Now reports the selected
           channels by IF as they are read. Use ob->ifs[cif].cl for
           constructing each IF. Removed call to putIF() and merged
           this into ob_select().  Zero fill unsampled IFs. Set
           ob->state=OB_SELECT on success without getting a start IF.
           Call iniIF() for single IF data-sets.
          ob_ready(): Added OB_SELECT case.
          getfreq(): Re-written to return mean channel frequencies for
           one or all IFs and to use the new If::df member. Now
           requires OB_SELECT state.
          getbw(): Re-written to return channel bandwidth sum for one
           or all IFs and to use the new If::df member. Now requires
           OB_SELECT state.
          ob_get_select(): New private function of ob_select(), used
           to check, and if OK, install the new channel and
           polarization selections.
          get_cif_state() \ New functions to be used to bracket code
          set_cif_state() / that potentially change the current IF.
        resoff.c:
          resoff(): Now processes either the current IF, or all
           sampled IFs. Previously it only processed the current IF.
           Bracketed code with get_cif_state() and set_cif_state().
           Fixed BUG? where 0 model amplitudes led to corrections of
           0.0. Unity is now substituted for amplitude corrections
           that are <= 0.0. Also added check for the lack of an
           established model after the call to mergemod().
          clroff(): Now processes either the current IF, or all IFs.
           Previously it only processed the current IF. If the current
           IF is sampled then its visibilities are modified
           accordingly.
          app_bcor(): Now requires ob->state == OB_RAWIF.
          ini_bcor(): Now processes either the current IF, or all IFs.
           Previously it processed all IFs. Fixed BUG - a missing
           bptr++ meant that only the corrections of the first
           baseline got cleared.
        slfcal.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Uses new nextIF()
           semantics. Removed doall=1 argument of moddif(). Discarded
           endslfcal(). Catered for the new cif argument in the call
           to ed_Telcor(). Bracketed slfcal() code with
           get_cif_state() and set_cif_state().
        specplot.c:
          Changed to use ob->ifs[*].coff instead of working out IF
           channel offsets itself. Changed the default flags to
           include the display of error bars. Modified to use the new
           IF frequency description members.
        spectra.c:
          Added call to ed_flush(). Modified to use the new If::df
           member.
        stnstr.c:
           Added ob_ready(OB_INDEX) call.
        telcor.c:
          uncalib(): Added ob_ready(OB_INDEX) requirement. Now only
           uncalibrates the visibilities in memory if the observation
           is at least in OB_GETIF state.
          recalib(): Renamed to app_Telcor().
          app_Telcor(): This now takes an IF index argument specifying
           which IF's corrections to apply. Now requires observation
           state of OB_RAWIF.
          ed_Telcor(): Now takes an IF index argument and edits the
           visibilities only if that IF is in memory.
          adj_Telcor(): Now takes an IF index argument and adjusts the
           visibilities only if that IF is in memory. Substitute 1 for
           amplitude corrections that are <= 0.0.
          clr_Telcor(): Now takes an IF index argument and adjusts the
           visibilities only if that IF is in memory. Use 1 for
           amplitude corrections that are <= 0.0.
        telspec.c:
          Added special error message for when an empty specification
           yields no triangles.
        timplt.c:
          timplt(): Added cif argument and ob_ready(OB_SELECT).
           Bracket code with calls to get_cif_state() and
           set_cif_state().
          new_Tpar(): Added cif argument and initial getIF() Added []
           keys to step through IFs using nextIF() and getIF(). Added
           a new title line, and display the IF index along with the
           sub-array index. Changed default IF and channel editing
           modes to global. Added IF index argument to ed_integ()
           call.
          t_pldata() - Changed declaration to static.
        uvaver.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_INDEX. Modified call to ob_select()
           to account for its new return type. Modified to explicitly
           reselect the original stream channel list and polarization
           if one was previously selected. Added doall=1 to
           ini_bcor(). Added call to ed_flush().
        uvf_read.c:
          Added If::coff initialization code. Modified If
           intialization code to handle the new frequency description
           members (df,bw instead of chan_bw, full_bw, sb). Expanded
           the description of each IF.
        uvf_write.c:
          Added call to ed_flush().
        uvinvert.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT and moved the ob_ready() call
           from the private uvbin() function into the public
           uvinvert() function. Uses new nextIF() semantics. Bracketed
           uvinvert() code with get_cif_state() and set_cif_state()
           calls. Discarded binerr(). Modified to use the new IF
           frequency descriptor members.
        uvplot.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Uses new nextIF() semantics.
           Bracketed uvplot() code with get_cif_state() and
           set_cif_state() calls. Label with getfreq(all IFs), instead
           of ob->stream.freq. Removed pointless IF editing toggle.
           Changed default channel editing mode to global. Added IF
           index argument to ed_integ() call.
        uvradplt.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Uses new nextIF() semantics.
           Bracketed uvradplt() code with get_cif_state() and
           set_cif_state() calls. Label with getfreq(all IFs), instead
           of ob->stream.freq. Changed default channel editing mode to
           global. Added IF index argument to ed_integ() call.
        uvrange.c:
          Uses new nextIF() semantics. Added ob_ready() call.
           Bracketed code with get_cif_state() and set_cif_state().
        vedit.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Added cif argument. Added []
           keys to step through sampled IFs using nextIF() and
           getIF(). Added paired get_cif_state() and set_cif_state()
           in vedit().
        visflags.c:
          Added ob_ready(OB_GETIF).
        visplot.h:
          Added cif argument to prototypes of corplot,vedit,timplt,
           clsplot.
        vlbhead.c:
          Extended the description of IFs as in uvf_read.c
        vplot.c:
          Added a new title line, and displayed the IF index along
           with the baseline specification. Added initial nextIF() and
           getIF() to new_Vedpar(). Changed default IF and channel
           editing modes to global.
        vplot.h:
          Added cif argument to new_Vedpar() prototype.
        wmapbeam.c:
          Changed OB_STREAM to OB_SELECT. Modified to use getfreq(all
           IFs) and getbw(all IFs) instead of ob->stream.freq and
           ob->stream.bw.
        uvrotate.c:
          Added ob_ready() call and only apply rotation to
           visibilities if an IF is in memory, ie. if
           ob->state>=OB_RAWIF.

04/18/95 vedit.c clplot.c uvradplt.c

         vedit.c: Added allowance for 'i' and 'w' flags in the user
                  'vflags' string.
         clplot.c: Added allowance for 'i', 'w', and ' ' flags in the
                   user 'vflags' string.
         uvradplt.c: Added allowance for '.' flag in user 'rflags'
                     string.

04/13/95 modfit.c

         While writing the new channel selection code, I discovered
         that at the start of each iteration, instead of reading
         the first available IF, modelfit continued to use the last IF
         for a second time. Now fixed.

04/11/95 specplot.c specplot.h spectra.h spectra.c baselist.c baselist.h
         pollist.c pollist.h

         New command called specplot, for plotting visibility spectra.
         specplot.c and specplot.h contain the main specplot code.
         spectra.c and spectra.h contain code to construct spectra
         from the raw data in the uvdata scratch file.
         baselist.c and baselist.h contain code to allow specification
         manipulation and iteration on baseline group specifications.
         pollist.c and pollist.h contain code to allow specification
         and iteration on lists of polarizations.
         
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Difmap 2.1c released (04/10/95). This is the same as 2.1b, except that
it contains the new version of mapres.c and the changes made to
incorporate P_DIFFn and P_REFANT keywords. I am not ready to release the
other changes yet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
04/10/95 mapres.c
         Thomas Krichbaum noticed a bug in mapres.c that appeared
         for rectangular map grids when the number of elements in
         RA exceeded that in DEC. This was a bug in the code that
         smooths residual before adding the model and was due to
         ny being used in a place where nx was meant to be used.
         The symptom was that a copy of the left half of the residual
         map appeared duplicated in the right half of the restored map.

03/21/95 symtab.c

     Details: Moved the error message regarding non-alphanumeric
              characters out of search_table() to add_symbol().
              With this change get_symbol() no longer gives a crytic
              error message when non-alphanumeric characters are
              entered - it just reports such strings as though they
              didn't match (which they don't). Also added support for
              numeric digits past the first character of an
              identifier - somehow this got omitted before.

03/21/95 units.c

     Details: Modified skyunits() to use Symtab code. The mapunits
              command no longer requires exactly matching unit names.

03/21/95 obutil.c

     Details: I just noticed that selecting an unavailable polarization
              causes ob_select() to delete the observation and abort.
              I have changed it to revert to the default polarization
              (as it used to) rather than aborting.

03/21/95 symtab.h symtab.c enumpar.h enumpar.c difmap.c color.c specplot.c

     Details: Added type name to symbol table descriptor and new_Symtab()
              and new_Enumpar(). This is used to lend context to error
              reports.

03/20/95 obs.h obutil.c specplot.c difmap.c obpol.c makefile.distrib
         enumpar.c

     Details: Moved find_stokes() from obutil.c to be a static function
              of obpol.c.
              Removed Stokes_name() and name_Stokes() from obutil.c.
              Created new file stokes.c containing a new Stokes_name()
              and Stokes_id() functions. These use the enumpar symbol
              table code so that polarization name lookup is now minmatch
              and case insensitive. Renamed name_Stokes() to Stokes_id() in
              obs.h difmap.c specplot.c. Added stokes.o to makefile.distrib.
              Changed name_enum() to return original names rather than
              their lower-case symbol table versions.

03/20/95 vlbhead.c

     Details: In two lprintf() statements, the (long) component of
              the date was written with a %d instead of a %ld.
              Also changed "Mean Epoch" time input to julday() to
              a double from a long (this wasn't a bug).

03/17/95 difmap.c

     Details: Added del_MapBeam(vlbmap) to dmap_end().

03/17/95 uvf_read.c uvf_write.c obs.h subarray.c

     Details: Difmap now reads, records and writes P_REFANT and P_DIFFnn
              header keywords to UV FITS antenna tables. These
              keywords are not documented in Going AIPS, so I didn't
              know about them until Scott Aaron pointed out that
              Difmap appeared to discard them. Also fixed a bug in
              some so far unused re-allocation code in subarray.c,
              in functions new_Stations(), new_Baselines() the
              initialized elements started at element 0 instead of the
              first previously un-initialized element.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Difmap 2.1b released.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

03/16/95 obedit.c

     Details: A bug relating back to the change of telescope iterators
              when I made the change over to telspec.c. When station
              based editing was used, only the first baseline of that
              station got edited in the data and IF scratch files, whereas
              the editing appeared to be correct for the currently selected
              stream. This calls for a new release, quick!

03/15/95 obs.c

     Details: Modified Obs_alloc() to initialize ob->stream.pol.type
              to NO_POL. The Difmap 'select' command uses
              ob->stream.pol.type as the default polarization to use
              when no polarization is specified. This has been using
              an un-initialized value.

03/15/95 obpol.c obutil.c

     Details: Changed get_Obpol() such that asking for NO_POL results in
              a default polarization being substituted. Modified ob_select()
              to use this, rather than have it do the same thing itself.

03/10/95 fits_src/{sysfits.h,sysfits.c,fits.c}

     Details: I have coded up a set of data-type representation conversion
              functions in a new file called sysfits.c. In sysfits.h I now
              use these functions to support Dec Alphas running OSF.

03/10/95 maplot.c

     Details: The code that flipped the grey-scale ramp to cater for
              paper hardcopy printers, didn't account for changes in
              the brightness or transfer function. The new code
              negates the contrast as before, but also changes the
              brightness to 1-brightness.

03/08/95 uvradplt.c

     Details: I was incorrectly using the minimum UV radius returned
              by uvrange() as the minimum projected UV distance to
              plot in projplot. Instead this should be zero, and I
              have changed it to that.

03/08/95 symtab.c

     Details: What a time to find a bug! add_symbol() didn't terminate
              its copies of symbol names. Given the min-match behavior
              of the table, this only showed up when ambiguous matches
              were listed. I have corrected the released version of
              Difmap 2.1. The FTP log shows one person (unknown
              user at wsrt00.nfra.nl) as having pulled over the new
              version.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Difmap 2.1 released.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

03/07/95 version.h configure README

     Details: I released version 2.1 of Difmap. This was announced on
              the NRAO vlbi exploder.

03/06/95 wmapbeam.c

     Details: primhdu() now rights RA and DEC with the appropriate
              projection code. I also changed the RA and DEC axis
              values to use lmtora() and lmtodec() to get the RA and
              DEC of the map center, instead of assigning the east and
              north direction cosine offsets as linear pixel
              increments wrt the source RA and DEC.

03/06/95 All plotting modules in difmap.

     Details: As promised in the last release, I have removed support
              for older versions of PGPLOT. It was getting too painful
              to keep the ifdef's up to date and to test both modes.
              The PGIMAG and PGBAND pre-processor variables are thus
              now obsolete and have been removed from the
              configuration options.

03/06/95 difmap.c maplot.h maplot.c help/beampos.hlp

     Details: Added a new command (beampos) to allow specification
              of the disposition of the mapplot clean beam ellipse.

03/05/95 obs.h obutil.c uvf_read.c uvf_write.c hms.c vlbutil.h

     Details: I have added support for NCP projection in addition to
              SIN projection. This entailed:
              1. Modifying uvf_read.c to extract projection names from
                 UU,VV,WW random parameter names.
              2. Adding a Proj projection enumeration type to obs.h.
              3. Adding name_Proj() and Proj_name() lookup functions to
                 obutil.c (and prototypes in obs.h).
              4. Moved xytora() and xytodec() from hms.c and vlbutil.h
                 to obutil.c and obs.h. Also renamed to lmto..() to
                 avoid name clash with xytorad().
              4. Modifying lmtora() and lmtodec() to cater for
                 projections other than SIN projection.
              
02/21/95 vlbhead.c

     Details: Scan information used the default scan interval instead
              of newer per sub-array scangaps set by the scangap
              command. I have fixed this.

02/20/95 obutil.c obpol.c obs.h

     Details: Polarization combinations were written inline in
              ob_select(). I also needed the same code for forming
              visibility spectra, so I have come up with a more
              general scheme in which a polarization-specific dispatch
              function is called to combine polarizations for each
              visibility. The new call get_Obpol() sets this up
              beforehand, recording the dispatch function and its
              parameters in an Obpol structure, now recorded in
              ob->stream.pol.

02/20/95 uvf_read.c

     Details: I had not realized that it was possible for autocorrelation
              visibilities to be interleaved with normal cross-correlation
              visibilities in UV FITS files. The VLBA now does this.
              Fortunately, the default behavior in AIPS SPLIT is to
              discard them, so this has not been a problem. I have
              modified loc_base() to trap for such visibilities and
              quietly discard them.

02/19/95 obshift.c obs.h

     Details: I added an obunshift() function to undo all shifts applied
              with obshift().

02/17/95 dpage.c uvaver.c

     Details: I have generalized the static dp_cal() function of uvaver.c
              and moved it to dpage.c. I have also written a new function
              dp_shift() to apply the current east and northward shifts to
              the the integration in the record I/O buffer.

02/17/95 obshift.c

     Details: uvshift() objected if it didn't get a fully initialized
              initialized stream. This caused ob_select() to fail
              when selecting a new stream if a shift was in place.
              I have changed it to accept the pre-stream indexed state.

02/14/95 vedit.c

     Details: At the command line, specifying zero for the number of
              rows, requests the max appropriate number of plots per
              page. The equivalent interactive option 's' didn't
              accept zero at all. I have changed it such that both the
              absence of any number or the number 0, mean the same as
              the command line argument.

02/13/95 difmap.c help/antenna_names.hlp

     Details: Added an antenna_names help topic to describe the syntax
              and interpretation of the new telescope specifications.

02/13/95 difmap.c

     Details: Incorporated the new telescope specification and
              iteration functions. All plot functions now take
              telescope specification arguments. resoff and selfant
              also do, and use the new iterators to iterate through
              the specifications. Previously resoff required at least
              one argument and would only correct one baseline at a
              time.

02/13/95 timplt.c corplt.c vplot.c vedit.c clplot.c uvplot.c
         uvradplt.c

     Details: I have incorporated the new telescope specification and
              iteration functions into all of the plotting commands.
              In the process, non-interactive plotting has become
              better supported, with wild-card specifications
              (specifications with ommitted trailing components) being
              interpretted correctly along with more information being
              printed to the screen as pages are plotted.

              vplot and cpplot now allow one to switch to a mode in
              which baselines/triangles are seen just once, using a
              new 'O' key. As before, vplot by default plots all
              baselines to each reference antenna. The new option only
              plots baselines in which the index of the second antenna
              is greater than that of the reference.

              I have also made it possible to specify cross-hair mode
              (via the '+' character) in the cpplot and vplot flag
              strings.

              I have also added warning messages to the cursor
              functions, so that when the cursor must be within a
              plot and the user presses a cursor key when the cursor
              is not within any plot, they are told why nothing
              happened. (I got caught by this myself, and ended up
              killing difmap because I thought that it was stuck in
              cursor input mode :-).

              clplot now defaults to showing all unique triangles to
              the first antenna of the first sub-array. Previously it
              was obligatory to tell it what to plot. It now also
              allows one to step to the neighboring specification,
              whereas before it obeyed the triangle specification
              explicitly and stopped when no more triangles were
              available that met the specification. This included
              adding capital N and P as Next and Previous sub-array
              keys.

              The command-line argument of the tplot is now a literal
              string sub-array specification, where before it was an
              integer sub-array index. I have also added a 'T' key to
              allow interactive keyboard selection of the next
              sub-array to be displayed.

              In uvplot, radplot and projplot, an empty specification
              input in response to the 'T' key, (or from the command
              line) now de-selects highlighting.

              I have removed all the *_labinc() functions and calls
              from all plot commands. They were originally there to
              counter bugs in pgtbox(), but have been commented out
              for a while, because the bugs appear to have been fixed.

02/13/95 obutil.c obs.h

     Details: I have removed the telescope specification functions
              from obutil.c and obs.h, in deferrence to the new code
              in telspec.c and telspec.h. I have also renamed
              find_base() to loc_base(), since find_base() is now a
              more general function in telspec.c.

02/13/95 clstel.c clstel.h -> clphs.c clphs.h

     Details: telspec.c now contains the triangle specification and
              iteration routines that were in clstel.c, so I have
              deleted clstel.c and clstel.h and replaced them with
              clphs.c and clphs.h, which only contain closure phase
              specific functions.

02/13/95 telspec.h telspec.c

     Details: I have created a general set of telescope specification
              input, output and interation functions for use
              throughout difmap. This replaces all the ad hoc
              iterators in the plotting functions, and provides
              a uniform interface to all commands that require
              sub-array, telescope, baseline or closure triangle
              specification arguments.

02/10/95 corplt.c

     Details: The title said Baselines to <telescope_name>! Changed
              this to Calibration corrections for <telescope_name>.

              Memory leak. del_Corpar() wasn't being called to release
              memory allocated to the plot descriptor.

              corplot() wasn't returning its potential error status (ierr).

02/08/95 telspec.c

     Details: Added a check for exact telescope name matches, to prevent
              them from being treated as ambiguous in the event of there
              being another telescope name with the same prefix.

01/12/94 modfit.c

     Details: Negative fluxes had been deemed unphysical so were not
              allowed. This resulted in modelfit being unable to fit
              absorption features. I have now corrected this.

01/11/94 model.h model.c modfit.c modvis.c

     Details: Added an SZ model component type.

01/09/94 sphere_src/compile.c

     Details: The contents of `` literal string expression delimiters
              were not being checked to ensure that they were string
              expressions.

01/02/94 maplot.c

     Details: mapplot now plots windows on hardcopy devices for residual
              maps, but not restored maps. Previously CLEAN windows were
              only displayed on interactive devices.

12/31/94 wmapbeam.c

     Details: Changed to prepend the polarization name to the AIPS IMCLASS
              history entry. Previously 'I' was always prepended.

12/31/94 obutil.c

     Details: I still had the equation for U wrong!
              Now corrected and compared against AIPS MX.

12/17/94 obutil.c

     Details: Clearly nobody had tried mapping derived versions of
              either U or V polarizations. The equations used to
              combine the source polarizations were wrong.

11/06/94 mapres.c

     Details: res_smooth() was placing the smoothed the residuals 1 pixel
              too low along both X and Y. This was only particularly apparent
              if not much cleaning had been done, since the convolved model
              was placed in the correct position. Steve Unwin noticed that
              the first row of pixels extending across the top of the plot
              in maplot appeared to be shifted left by one pixel wrt the next
              row of pixels.

11/06/94 timplt.c

     Details: t_edbox() presented a bogus informational message, telling
              the user to press 'H' for help on selecting a new UT range.
              I must have accidently copied this from t_newut().

10/31/94 Implemented selfcal-correction flags.

   editing.hlp selfcal.hlp selfflag.hlp vplot.hlp cpplot.hlp tplot.hlp
   uncalib.hlp corplot.hlp

     Wrote new 'editing' help topic, and updated other help files to
     include details specific to correction flagging.

   obs.h

     Added 'bad' flag to Telcor correction containers.

     Splitted off Bascor typedef from Telcor, since Telcor now has one
     more member than Bascor.

     Added 'bad' flag bitmask to Visibility container.

     Added prototype for new ed_Telcor() function.
     Added prototype for new adj_Telcor() function.
     Added prototype for new clr_Telcor() function.

   telcor.c

     Added ob_ready() clause.

     Added 'doflag' arguments and unflagging and flagging code to
     uncalib() and recalib().

     Removed the fabs(gcor) code from uncalib() and recalib(), since
     null amplitude corrections are no longer encoded as -1.

     Wrote new ed_Telcor() function which records and applies changes to
     telescope correction flags.

     Wrote new adj_Telcor() function which makes incremental changes to
     a single telescope correction.

     Wrote new clr_Telcor() function which removes the correction of one
     telescope.

   slfcal.c

     Modified count_tel() so that it no longer does editing, or counts
     dropped visibilities.

     Modified get_usable() to apply correction flags and count corrections
     that are dropped due to insufficient sampling. Dropped corrections for
     telescopes whose gains are marked as fixed are not counted or flagged.
     (Previously counts of dropped visibilities were kept, rather than
      dropped telescope corrections).

     (Now calls modified visflags() function, so the new flagging is
      now fully supported by slfcal.c).

   visflags.c

     Changed check for flag status to use !vis->bad instead of vis->wt>0.

   subarray.c

     Changed tcor->amp_cor initialization to 1.0f from -1.0f.

     Added tcor->bad = 0; initialization to new_Telcor().

     Added vis->bad = FLAG_DEL; initialization to new_Visibilities().

   obutil.c

     Changed getIF() to translate from file weight encoded flags to vis->bad
     type flags.

     Changed getIF() to translate from vis->bad type flags to file weight
     encoded flags.

     Removed code in ob_select that converted sum of weights to -ve if flagged.

     Added code to record vis->bad flag information in ob_select().

     Added doflag=1 argument to call to recalib().

   uvf_write.c

     Added code in primdata() to apply correction flags to the output data.

   uvaver.c

     Removed fabs(amp_cor) since null amplitude corrections are no longer
     encoded as -1.0f.

     Added code to dp_cal() to freeze correction flags into the data,
     and added doflag=1 argument to call to uncalib() so that the
     correction flags are discarded after being frozen.

   corplt.c

     Decided upon different editing modes:

      Left mouse button:   Flag correction (instead of flag + reset).
      Middle mouse button: Reset correction (as before).

      Renamed c_zaptel() to c_edit_cor() and added mode argument.

      Rewrote c_edit_cor() to use ed_Telcor() and clr_Telcor().

     Modified c_pldata() to use tcor->bad flagging info.

     Changed 'badsym' symbol to an 'x'.

   vplot.c

     Modified to use vis->bad bitmask to determine flag state.

     Modified to plot visibilities that are only correction flagged, with
     a different symbol and color.

   vedit.c

     Modified to use vis->bad bitmask to determine flag status.

   clstel.h

     Declared Clflag closure-phase flag status enumeration.

     Added 'int bad' member to Clphs closure-phase container. This is to
     be used as a bitmask union of Clflag enumerators.

   clstel.c

     Changed flagging to use vis->bad and cp->bad flag mask code in
     get_clphs().

   clplot.c

     Changed flagging to use cp->bad flag mask.

     Changed c_pldata() to use correction-flags color and plot symbols where
     approriate.

   timplt.c

     Changed t_sampling() to record correction flags as well as normal
     flags.

     Changed t_pldata() to plot correction flag colors where appropriate.

     Changed t_edbox() to take account of correction flags when deciding
     whether to toggle flag status.

   obedit.c

     Modified to apply in-core edits to vis->bad, instead of through the sign
     of vis->wt.

   difmap.c

     Gave the uncalib command a third argument, to be used to request that
     calibration corrections be removed.

   addmod.c moddif.c modfit.c resoff.c uvinvert.c uvplot.c uvradplt.c uvrange.c
   wtscal.c

     Modified test for flagged/deleted visibilities to test against vis->bad.

10/29/94 uvaver.c uvf_write.c

     Details: Telcor and Bascor have always been just different names for
              the same type. This hid the fact that I had twice accidently
              declared a variable of type Telcor where a Bascor type was
              required.

10/26/94 uvaver.c

     Details: uvaver refused to do anything because I had forgotten
              to update the observation state after obs_Alloc().
              Now fixed.

10/26/94 uvaver.c

     Details: Changed amp_cor to fabs(amp_cor) to ensure that the corrections
              that are frozen into the data are always +ve, regardless of
              the convention to denote null amplitude calibrations as -1.
              This was a bug - found while working on new correction flag
              version. This will have caused 180 degrees of phase shift.
              Since the visibilities that went with these uncorrected
              visibilities were probably flagged, the harm done is
              probably not as disastrous as it might have been.

10/25/94 telcor.c

     Details: Noticed that neither uncalib() nor recalib() checked
              ob->state. No harm done since higher level routines
              were already doing the required check. I have added
              a call to ob_ready() to handle this correctly. I have
              also updated some of the code, to remove redundant
              intermediate variables.

10/23/94 sphere_src/help.c sphere_src/func.c help/apropos.hlp
         help/help.hlp help/difmap.hlp help/makeindex.hlp

     Details: Another overhaul of the help system. The technique of
              reading the intro line from each help file to display
              an index of help topics in a given module, or for apropos,
              was getting too slow with the number of commands now in
              difmap. Instead, I have now written a 'makeindex' command
              which compiles help indexes for each module and places
              them in files with the module name postfixed with an '.idx'
              extension. This need only be called by the administrator
              (ie. me) whenever help files are added/removed or their
              intro lines changed. I have created new functions in
              help.c to open/read/close such index files, and modified
              help_module(), and apropos() to use them. I have also
              updated apropos to show general help topics as well as
              commands/functions, and to indicate which modules the
              matches occur in. Also changed help_module() to precede
              the topic index with the contents of a module .hlp file
              if present, and I changed the order of the indexes, such
              that the general help topic list, appears before the
              list of command/function topics.

10/23/94 pager_src/pager.c

     Details: page_file() was closing the input file, even when it hadn't
              been responsible for opening it. It now only closes the file
              if it opened it itself.

10/22/94 sphere_src/help.c difmap.c

     Details: Moved help topics to appear before the list of commands
              and functions. Also added a new models.hlp general help
              topic.

10/21/94 uvf_read.c obs.c intrec.c obutil.c addmod.c

     Details: Moved ini_Intrec() from get_uvdata() to new_Observation().
              Added ob->state = OB_DATA; to new_Observation().
              Added clrmod() call to new_Observation().
              Added clause to only do select in new_Observation() if the
              choice of selection is unambiguous.
              Added ob->state=OB_DATA and ob->state=OB_INDEX statements
              to ini_Intrec(), bracketing the body of the function.
              Added ob->state=OB_INDEX and ob->state=OB_STREAM statements
              to ob_select() bracketing the body of the function.
              fixmod() now returns an error if no stream has been selected.
              For this reason obremcmp() and obaddcmp() now also return NULL
              if an attempt to modify the established model is made before
              a stream has been selected. Changed maplot::zapcmp() to handle
              such a possibility.
              The 'save' command now doesn't emit a 'select' command unless
              a selection has been made.
              
10/21/94 uvaver.c

     Details: Modified uvaver to only call ob_select if a stream had been
              selected before uvaver was called.

10/21/94 obs.h obs.c obutil.c addmod.c clplot.c clstel.c difmap.c if.c maplot.c
         moddif.c modfit.c nextif.c obedit.c obhead.c obshift.c resoff.c
         scans.c slfcal.c uvaver.c uvf_write.c uvinvert.c uvplot.c uvradplt.c
         vlbhead.c vlbhist.c wmapbeam.c wtscal.c vedit.c

     Details: Added a 'state' member to the Observation descriptor to
              encode its state of initialization. Renamed ob_bad() to
              ob_ready() and added a state argument to it so that it
              can check whether the descriptor is in a state requested
              by the caller.

10/21/94 addmod.c maplot.c resoff.c vlbhist.c

     Details: Changed limgering ob==NULL checks to ob_bad() calls, in
              clrmod(), new_Maplot(), clroff(), showhist()

10/20/94 difmap.c spectral_line.hlp

     Details: Added a new informational help topic on spectral-line
              mapping.

10/13/94 difmap.c

     Details: The 'save' command now records the current inter-scan gaps.

10/13/94 difmap.c uvweight.hlp selflims.hlp selfflag.hlp

     Details: I have changed the following setup commands to not overwrite
              existing parameter values with defaults, where trailing
              arguments are omitted. This makes these commands more
              consistent with other commands of a similar nature.
                uvweight, selflims, selfflag

10/13/94 difmap.c uvtaper.hlp uvrange.hlp scangap.hlp uvzero.hlp shift.hlp
         selftaper.hlp uvweight.hlp selflims.hlp mapsize.hlp

     Details: I have changed the following setup commands to show their
              current state if not supplied with any arguments:
                uvtaper, uvrange, scangap, uvzero, shift, selftaper,
                uvweight, selflims, mapsize.

10/13/94 difmap.c

     Details: Added a 'showpar' command to display the current parameter
              settings by displaying the command file that the 'save'
              command would normally write, but to stdout.

10/09/94 wmapbeam.c

     Details: Difmap now adds an AIPS IMCLASS history line to output
              image FITS files, as well as to UV-FITS files. Residual
              and dirty maps are annotated as IMAP, clean maps by ICLN
              and dirty beam images by IBEAM.

10/09/94 corplot.c maplot.c uvradplt.c timplt.c uvplot.c vplot.c vedit.c
         vplot.h

     Details: Having added new cross-hair rubber-band cursor modes to
              xwdriv, I have now modified all the difmap plot commands
              to exploit them. All commands now understand the '+' key
              to mean toggle the cross-hair cursor on or off if the
              device supports it. Those that allow selection of X-axis
              ranges now initially display a single vertical line that
              follows the cursor, used to select the start position of
              the range, then display two lines, one fixed at the
              selected start of the range and a second that follows
              the cursor, and is used to select the end of the range.
              The equivalent for Y-axis ranges is also supported in
              those commands that allow Y-axis range selections.

10/09/94 xwdriv.c pgxwin_server.c

     Details: I have again re-written the /xwindow driver. Given that
              the first re-write required an external process, it
              seemed silly not to take that further and write a full
              blown PGPLOT window server, to provide the option of
              having windows stay around between uses. The new driver
              can be accessed through two names, /xwindow to open
              windows that go away when not in use, and /xserve to
              open windows that persist after use.

09/28/94 wmapbeam.c

     Details: The X-axis coordinates of clean components in FITS map
              files generated by difmap were written with the wrong
              sign in the CC table. Dhiraj noticed this when plotting
              the model against visibility data in AIPS. AIPS VBLPLT
              now shows the same quality of fit as difmap.

09/24/94 maplot.c uvradplt.c

     Details: The main cursor loops of mapplot,radplot and projplot were
              not checking for cursor read errors.

09/16/94 fits_src/fits.c

     Details: If the last HDU in a FITS file had no associated data
              new_Fits() moaned that the FITS file was shorter than
              expected, even if the header specified that there was
              not supposed to be any data. I have fixed this.

09/12/94 maplot.c color.c color.h

     Details: Random stipple is no longer handled as a special class
              of colormap. Mapplot now handles random stipple itself
              via PGGRAY. Before, if a device had too few colors, the
              current colormap would be replaced by a special stipple
              colormap. Since difmap now remembers the last selected
              colormap, if the user then opened a new device and tried
              to use mapplot, PGGRAY would be called upon to do random
              stipple, even if there were sufficient colors to plot
              a normal colormap.

09/12/94 maplot.c

     Details: When plotting grey-scale, PGGRAY reverses the
              grey-levels on hard-copy devices. PGIMAG doesn't, so I
              changed maplot to do this when plotting grey-scale.
              Otherwise plots appear mostly black, which looks
              horrible on a white sheet of paper and wastes ink.

09/12/94 difmap.c telcor.c obs.hcorplot.hlp gscale.hlp selfant.hlp
         selfcal.hlp selftaper.hlp uncalib.hlp

     Details: Amplitude corrections were sometimes incorrectly refered
              to as gain corrections. I have changed this.

09/11/94 uvf_read.c uvf_write.c obs.h subarray.c binan.c vlbhist.c

     Details: Difmap was arbitrarily assigning the row number in
              output AN tables as the antenna number. I had assumed
              that the antenna number was only relevant within a
              single file, whereas AIPS allows one to share tables
              containing antenna numbers. Difmap would also moan if
              presented with an AN tables in which antenna numbers
              differed from their row number in AN tables. Difmap now
              preserves antenna numbers. Since difmap discards unused
              AN table entries this results in AN tables in which the
              row number and antenna number will frequently disagree.
              Phil Diamond says that he believes that AIPS can cope
              with this, and won't complain about antennas that have
              been removed as long as no visibility cites them.

09/08/94 xwdriv.c

     Details: Complete re-write of PGPLOT /xwin driver completed.
              Among other things, the new version implements the
              new PGBAND and PGQCR opcodes and buffered the
              colormap updates required for the new colormap code.

09/08/94 recolor.c color.c color.h symtab.h mapplot.c

     Details: Re-wrote all of the mapplot colormap code. Deleted
              recolor.c. color.c and color.h now allow support
              for any number of color tables, with control over
              brightness and contrast etc.. Mapplot now allows
              interative colortable manipulation.

09/08/94 symtab.h symtab.c enumpar.c difmap.c

     Details: Wrote generalized min-match symbol table routines and
              re-implemented enumeration arguments with them.

09/08/94 sphere_src/lex.c

     Details: Changed literal string termination condition such that
              it doesn't terminate on a comma if the comma is within
              unclosed parentheses, also so that it terminates at the
              first unmatched close parenthesis rather than the final
              matching close parenthesis.

09/06/94 obutil.c

     Details: When combining two polarizations to a derived polarization
              I added the weights incorrectly. The result was weights that
              were 16 times too small - ouch.

09/04/94 maplot.c

     Details: Added PGPLOT buffering to plwins() and replot().

09/03/94 clplot.c

     Details: The world coordinate phases were degrees, whereas the
              functions that used cursor positions assumed that they
              were radians. Now changed to use radians throughout.

08/29/94 vplot.c cpplot.c

     Details: Upgraded cursor routines to use plot-descriptor dependant
              cursor descriptors, and added pgband features.

08/29/94 corplt.c

     Details: Upgraded cursor routines to use a cursor descriptor instead
              of lots of arguments to the cursor function. Also, although
              a band cursor is not required at the moment, in corplot,
              I have added the necessary features to use it in the future
              if ever required.

08/28/94 maplot.c uvplot.c uvradplot.c timplt.c

     Details: Added code to take advantage of pgband(). This is option
              is selected only if a pre-processor variable called PGBAND
              is defined.

08/28/94 maplot.c mapplot.hlp

     Details: Added 'L' key for simple re-display, since all other
              plotting commands have this.

08/28/94 pgc/pgc*.sh

     Details: Added the new pgband() PGPLOT library call.

08/28/94 uvradplot.c radplot.hlp projplot.hlp

     Details: Removed the confusing multi-IF editing option. Given that
              all IFs are displayed, there is no real need for this
              option.

08/10/94 model.c

     Details: Changed rmodel() to force components with major==0.0
              to be delta functions.

08/10/94 sphere_src/run.h

     Details: Changed MAXSTACK to 2000 since Steve was hitting the
              1000 limit.

08/05/94 modfit.c

     Details: modelfit was displaying the unshifted model. It now
              displays the shifted model.

08/01/94 addmod.c clrmod.c obs.c obshift.c slfcal.c

     Details: Moved clrmod code into addmod. Added continuum subtraction
              facilities. (I am writing this as of 09/09/94 so I don't
              remember the details - somehow I forgot to enter this at
              the time). I do remember that it involved re-writing most
              of the the code involving models.
 
07/31/94 uvf_read.c uvf_write.c obutil.c

     Details: The way that the sign of the spectral-line channel
              increment was being propagated was inconsistent and
              the result was that it was possible to loose it in the output
              UV file. The convention now is to follow that of FQ tables,
              where the unsigned channel bandwidth is kept along with a
              sideband name to encode the sign. I was using this when
              the frequency info came from FQ tables, but if the
              frequency info came from the primary header I used the
              alternate convention of making the channel bandwidth
              signed. The output functions were equally dislexic.

07/30/94 obs.h obs.c uvf_read.c uvf_write.c

     Details: I hadn't realised that AIPS ALTDEF info could be stored
              in UV FITS files. I now read and record these values
              in the observation structure and write them back to
              the output UV FITS file.

07/28/94 fits_src/bhdu.c

     Details: The NOST standard says that strings denoted by the 'rA' format
              specifier may be prematurely terminated with '\0'. It also says
              that a string in which the first character is '\0' is undefined.
              AIPS writes a single character code using format '1A' to
              encode the polarization type of a feed and in one file
              this code was '\0', obviously because it *was*
              undefined. bcol_val() read this OK, but when uvf_write
              came to writing an output FITS file bcol_set()
              interpretted this as a zero length string and returned 
              saying that no characters had been written. This is the
              error return of bcol_set() so the writer aborted. I have
              changed bcol_set() to explicitly write the '\0' byte if
              present before the ndata limit of the field (it should
              have done this anyway, but the fact that the HDU was
              already padded with '\0's hid the problem), and include
              the '\0' byte in the count of bytes written and returned.

07/28/94 binan.c

     Details: new_calpar() knew that the number of polarization calibration
              parameters could be 0, but new_Binan() took the
              resulting NULL return value of new_calpar() to mean that
              a memory allocation error had occured. I have changed
              this such that when new_calpar() returns NULL,
              new_Binan() now checks to see if nopcal is 0 before
              assuming that an error occured.

07/26/94 uvradplot.c

     Details: Fixed bug that meant that radplot only displayed the
              model of the last plotted sub-array.

07/26/94 slfcal.c

     Details: Fixed a bug where NaNs were produced if the (model-observed)
              visibility phase of a baseline of a poorely sampled telescope
              was exactly 90 degrees.


07/25/94 clplot.c

     Details: Added a clause to stop c_plot() from reseting the displayed
              UT range unless the displayed sub-array is changed.

07/25/94 vplot.c vplot.h

     Details: Added a clause to stop v_plot() from reseting the displayed
              UT range unless the displayed sub-array is changed.

07/25/94 uvplot.c help/uvplot.hlp difmap.c

     Details: Revamped cursor code added editing facilities and added
              the 'S' option of radplot for showing where a given point
              comes from. Also revamped autoranging code to allow for
              range changes due to editing. Changed difmap.c to account
              for editing in radplot.

07/22/94 hms.c maplot.c vlbutil.h

     Details: I had neglected to divide the eastward position offset
              by cos(dec) when calculating the map-center RA in maplot.
              In correcting this I have now gone further and implemented
              the formulae in AIPS memo 27 to do the full conversion
              from SIN-projection direction-cosine offsets to offset R.A.
              and Dec. [functions xytora() and xytodec()].

07/21/94 difmap.c

     Details: Added rflags and pflags to the variables saved by the
              save command. While doing this I noticed and fixed a
              bug that was preventing vflags from being saved correctly.
              Fix involved replacing a STRPTR() with a *STRPTR().

07/21/94 timplt.c difmap.c obs.h

     Details: I re-vamped the cursor entry code and added editing
              facilities to the tplot command.

07/20/94 uvradplt.c difmap.c obs.h

     Details: The code used for the radplot command now doubles as the
              code used for the new projplot command, used to plot
              data versus projected UV distance. In the process I
              changed the code to be able to plot phases as well as
              amplitudes and added keys to toggle model plotting,
              amplitude and phase plotting etc. Also implemented vplot style
              flag options, and added rflags and pflags option variables
              for radplot and projplot.

07/19/94 difmap.c addmod.c obs.h help/edmodel.hlp

     Details: Changed the default behavior of edmodel to be to present
              the whole model for editing. Also added an optional argument
              through which one can request that only the variable part of
              model be presented.

07/18/94 obutil.c

     Details: next_telbase() was not starting its search where it should
              have been. This prevented edits being applied properly to
              the scratch files. Now fixed.

07/11/94 vlbconst.h hms.c

     Details: Increased the precision of constants, since the reported
              Declination was out by a few mas after conversion to
              and from radians. Also changed the implementation of
              raddms() and radhms() functions to use the modf() ANSI
              C function, but without any differences noticeable
              in the results.

07/10/94 difmap.c wtscal.c wtscale.hlp

     Details: Changed wtscal to set the scale factor using an absolute
              scale rather than an incremental scale. Also changed
              the wtscale command into a function that returns the
              current wtscale value, and can also be used as a command.

07/10/94 sphere_src/help.c sphere_src/compile.c sphere_src/run.c

     Details: Add support for function that can be called as commands.

07/09/94 difmap.c maplot.c

     Details: Added header lines to the output of the wmodel command,
              specifying the phase-center RA and DEC and epoch, and
              distinguishing between the established and tentative
              models. I also made it not call the wmodel() function
              for models with < 1 component. I also added the epoch
              to the maplot center RA,DEC label.

07/08/94 difmap.c imstat.hlp

     Details: Added a new imstat() function. This returns one of
              a selection of map statistics. This supersedes the
              maprms() function, whch has been removed.

07/07/94 difmap.c uvinvert.c mapmem.c mapmem.h

     Details: Invert now calculates the theoretical noise from the weights,
              displays it to the user and records it in mb->noise.
              The wtscale command now marks the map and beam as out of
              date. This is because the new mb->noise parameter
              depends upon the absolute scale of the weights.

07/07/94 difmap.c uvstat.hlp

     Details: Added a new user function called uvstat(). This currently
              returns the RMS error between model and data,
              the reduced-chi-squared fit between model and data, or the
              number of unflagged visibilities.

07/07/94 difmap.c modfit.c modelfit.hlp

     Details: Previously "modelfit n", performed iterations 0 -> n-1.
              Now "modelfit n" performs iterations 0 -> n, and
              "modelfit 0" performs just iteration 0.

07/06/94 moddif.c slfcal.c selfcal.hlp startmod.hlp

     Details: Added option to moddif() to return either the overall
              goodness of fit, or just that of the current IF.
              Also made selfcal display the overall goodness of fit
              instead of one goodness of fit per IF.

07/06/94 slfcal.c

     Details: Added an explicit ed_flush() call to selfcal.

07/05/94 difmap.c addcmp.hlp

     Details: Added a new command to be used by scripts to add new model
              components to the tentative model.

07/05/94 difmap.c mapwin.c wwins.hlp wmodel.hlp

     Details: If the file-name argument is given as "", or omitted
              then wwins and wmodel now display their respective files
              on the standard output and in the log file.

07/03/94 obutil.c difmap.c obedit.c chlist.c chlist.h obs.h obs.c

     Details: The 'select' command now accepts mulitiple discontiguous
              channel ranges (although overlapping ranges may be
              specified). To support this the Observation 'stream'
              container now contains a list of channel ranges instead
              of a single range. ob_select() and obedit.c had to be
              modified to handle multiple channel ranges.
 
07/03/94 obutil.c difmap.c obedit.c

     Details: The 'select' command no longer has the side effect of
              discarding models. I have also removed the 'select'
              'preserve' argument used to over-ride the side effect.

06/27/94 obutil.c

     Details: name_Stokes() didn't complain if text followed a valid
              polarization name. Thus when a user typed: select I.1,1
              difmap didn't complain and the user didn't notice that
              they had selected a different range than expected.
              name_Stokes() now requires polarization strings to be
              '\0' terminated after the last character of the
              polarization name. While changing this I also
              noticed that some of the switch cases lacked break;
              statements. This bug only manifested if extra characters
              were typed. Thus the lack of sanity checking and this
              bug combined such that while select RR correctly
              selected RR, select RRR selected LR. I have now added
              the appropriate break statements.

06/26/94 obutil.c

     Details: I realized that ob_select()s use of weighted means, and
              its habit of discarding flagged visibilities while
              averaging spectral line channels together could
              potentially produced closure errors. After much
              agonizing and discussion, I have changed ob_select() to
              use an unweighted mean and to flag averages that include
              one or more flagged visibilities, and delete those that
              include one or more deleted visibilities.

06/26/94 clplot.c difmap.c

     Details: Added station editing to cplot, and changed the default
              editing mode to edit the selected reference station,
              baseline or triangle.

06/22/94 uvradplt.c radplot.hlp

     Details: Radplot didn't have control over the range of spectral
              line channels and IFs edited. I have added this feature.

06/21/94 clplot.c clstel.h difmap.c cpplot.hlp

     Details: Greg asked me to add interactive editing of closure
              phases in the cpplot command. I have done this.

06/21/94 difmap.c

     Details: Greg noticed that the 'save' command failed to write a
              'shift' command unless both east and north shifts were
              non-zero. Fixed.

06/19/94 model.c

     Details: If the were no components to be written, wmodel() would
              not write the column headings. This was ok for writing to
              normal model files, but writing the headings is a useful
              thing to do for edmodel users who want to describe a new
              model. wmodel() now always writes column headings.

06/18/94 makefile* units.c units.h difmap.c uvradplt.c uvinvert.c
         maplot.c uvplot.c modfit.c model.c mapres.c timplt.c corplt.c
         vplot.c clplot.c vlbconst.h  

     Details: The units of map-plane and UV plane coordinates that the
              user sees and uses can now be changed with the mapunits
              command. This is arbitrated through functions in
              units.c, which include internal vs. user coordinate
              conversion functions and unit labels. I also changed the
              static const variables in vlbconst.h to #define's so
              that they could be used as constant expressions in
              initializers.

06/18/94 uvradplt.c

     Details: Obviously I forgot to test the recent radplot changes on
              data-sets with multiple sub-arrays. Radplot was failing
              to display more than the first sub-array due to
              overriding the sub-array descriptor argument of
              r_basepl(). Also, r_findpt() was failing to increment
              its sub-array descriptor. Now fixed.

06/16/94 obs.h obs.c scans.c scans.h difmap.c vplot.c clplot.c corplot.c
         timplt.c scangap.hlp

     Details: Up until now, the gap taken to separate scans during
              plotting has been fixed at 1 hour. I have changed this
              by adding a scangap member to each sub-array descriptor
              of the observation, and by writing a scangap() function
              to install new values globally to all sub-arrays or to
              individual sub-arrays. The new 'scangap' user command
              can be used to interactively effect such changes.

06/15/94 mapmem.c mapmem.h mapclean.c difmap.c mapres.c uvinvert.c maprms.hlp

     Details: Added a user maprms() function to difmap. This returns
              the RMS deviation of pixel fluxes from the mean flux in
              the map. This should be useful for automatic mapping
              scripts. To implement this I decided to add maprms and
              mapmean members to the MapBeam class. I then changed the
              maprange() function to also calculate these quantities,
              and changed the name of maprange() to mapstats().

06/14/94 logio.c

     Details: Added a setvbuf call to enforce line-buffering of output
              to the log file. This ensures that the file will always
              be up to date, even if difmap crashes. Without this fix
              the log file is useless as an aid to debugging.

06/12/94 uvradplt.c radplot.hlp

     Details: Revamped the selection of plotted UV-radius and
              amplitude ranges and added a zoom option to allow
              interactive amplitude range selection.

06/10/94 uvradplt.c

     Details: radplot now displays and allows editing of visibilities
              from all IFs instead of just from the current default
              IF.

06/10/94 uvplot.c uvradplt.c

     Details: uvplot and radplot both start by not highlighting any
              station. Previously once you had highlighted a station
              it was not possible to go back to having no station
              highlighted. Now, if 'p' is pressed when at the start of
              the first sub-array, highlighting is removed.

06/10/94 clstel.c

     Details: Fixed bug where the sign of baseline phase contributions
              was incorrectly defined.

06/10/94 mapwin.c mapwin.h difmap.c

     Details: Changed peakwin to default to search for the largest
              flux instead of the largest absolute flux. Supplemented
              this with a second optional argument to the peakwin command
              to revert to the old behavior, since this is useful for
              spectral-line absorption mapping.

06/09/94 uvplot.c uvplot.hlp

     Details: uvplot now displays the sampling for all IFs, instead of
              just the current default IF. I have also added a zoom option,
              bound to the 'Z' key.

06/08/94 uvrange.c

     Details: Added the option of having uvrange() return the range for
              all IFs, instead of just that of the current IF.

06/06/94 obs.c obs.h obutil.c

     Details: Added a new command called 'addhist' to be used to add
              user specified history to the recorded history of an
              observation.
              Also added a new command called 'clrhist' to be used to
              delete FITS history information.

06/06/94 model.c

     Details: Edmod used tmpnam() to provide unique names for its temporary
              files. This placed the files in /usr/tmp/. Unfortunately
              emacs writes backup files (unless the file is in /tmp) so
              people who had been using edmod had many backup relics of
              temporary model files lying in /usr/tmp. I have now modified
              edmod to use my scrname() function to create a versioned
              edmod.scr file, so that while emacs will still write its
              backup file, there will only be one of them.

06/05/94 vplot.c vplot.h vedit.c vplot.hlp

     Details: I have added an amplitude/phase zoom option to vplot.
              While doing so I also re-vamped the cursor selection code
              to return a cursor descriptor rather than individual attributes.
              Also modified help output.

06/04/94 vplot.c clplot.c

     Details: I have further modified the way that model lines are drawn
              such that even when not in scan mode, where there is no data
              within one scan separation interval, no connecting line is
              drawn.

06/03/94 vplot.c

     Details: Improved the way that model lines wrap about the -pi and pi
              axes. Model lines that fall off the bottom now re-appear at
              the top without a vertical connecting line.

06/03/94 difmap.c

     Details: Removed an incorrect sanity check from restore_fn
              which prevented single component models from being restored.
              This will have been introduced when I moved the
              tentative model into the observation structure a week
              and a half ago.

06/03/94 vedit.c

     Details: In order to change Z to mean Zoom in all plotting commands
              I rebound the zap-pane option to key 'K' (kill-pane).

06/03/94 difmap.c clsplot.hlp -> cpplot.hlp radplt.hlp -> radplot.hlp

     Details: Changed the name of clsplot to cpplot and expanded radplt
              to radplot.

06/03/94 difmap.c

     Details: The save command was reporting an error after writing the
              select command because I had interpretted the return value
              of printf incorrectly. Now fixed.

06/03/94 visaver.c

     Details: When the scatter option was enabled, I was calculating the
              variance of the data within the averaging interval instead
              of the variance of the mean. Now fixed.

06/03/94 clstel.c clstel.h clplot.c difmap.c help/clsplot.hlp 

     Details: Added a new command (clsplot) to plot closure phases.

06/02/94 uvf_read.c

     Details: Greg encountered a UV FITS file with yet another variation
              in the name of the UU,VV,WW axes. Difmap now recognises the
              new name 'UU  -SIN' etc..

06/01/94 lmfit.c

     Details: Somehow I failed to remove the tentative lm->inc_par member
              from the Lmfit descriptor. It isn't used by anything and
              should have been removed long ago. The only place that it
              is referenced is in del_Lmfit(), which tries to free if it
              is non-NULL, causing a seg fault. I have no idea how it has
              never produced problems before now. Anyway I have removed
              the member and fixed del_Lmfit() to suit.

05/27/94 uvf_read.c obs.c obutil.c

     Details: I moved the select call from uvf_read.c into
              new_Observation() and added stream specification
              arguments to new_Observation, such that the default
              stream can be overriden at read time. I haven't added
              this to the observe command, but the possibility is
              there. I moved job of defaulting the polarization, where
              not given, to ob_select(), for which I wrote a new
              function comb_stokes() to do the job of searching out
              recorded and derived polarizations. Also ob_select() now
              returns the Observation descriptor so that it can be
              deleted on error, and made ob_select() more tolerant to
              user error by limiting stream selection arguments to
              legal values rather than aborting if out of range.

05/27/94 obs.h obs.c obutil.c addmod.c uvf_read.c uvaver.c difmap.c

     Details: The changes to uvaver that I made to accomodate last
              weeks move of the tentative model into the observation
              structure were incorrect. The model was deleted whenever
              uvaver was called. I have added an argument to ob_select()
              to tell it whether to completely delete all models or
              whether to preserve the established model in the tentative
              model. I have also added this argument to the difmap
              'select' command and finally fixed the 'save' command so
              that the 'select' command that it writes doesn't delete
              the model read by the preceding 'get' command.

05/25/94 uvradplt.c radplot.hlp

     Details: I finally gave in and added the option to allow one to
              specify rectangular areas whithin which to flag data.

05/24/94 modfit.c modelfit.hlp

     Details: The modelfit command has been unnoficially been in use
              for a few weeks. Now that the support facilities (edmod
              and component fiddling in maplot) are complete, I have
              finally gotten around to writing its help file and will
              announce its release.

05/24/94 maplot.c ellips.c modplot.c addmod.c modvis.c etc...

     Details: Mapplot can now be used to interactively add and remove
              model components. Fixed positive flux components are now
              displayed in green as before and variable ones in
              yellow. Elliptical components now also have the major
              and minor axes drawn so that the user can locate the
              center when selecting components to remove. It is also
              now possible to toggle plotting of the current models
              symbolically (including just displaying the variable
              part of the model). Previously if the model plot was
              required one had to specify it on the command line.
              Given that the tentative model now resides in the
              observation object it is also no longer necessary to
              establish the tentative model, as was required before.
              When new components are added they are temporarily
              placed in a scratch model, so that even if the rest of
              the model is not plotted, the new displayed components
              can be selected. The new components are then moved to
              the tentative model when the plot is re-displayed or
              mapplot is exited.
              I also removed the dolog option. This was an ill
              conceived option and never worked as intended.

05/24/94 A lot of changes to many files.

     Details: Obstensibly so to allow maplot, access to the tentative
              model but also because it seems sensible, I moved the
              tentative model into the observation object. This
              simplifies many things, especially in difmap.c and has
              allowed the writing of a number of useful utility
              functions (especially in addmod.c).

05/19/94 difmap.c

         Bug: Both selfcal and gscale should mark the beam as invalid
              if doing amplitude selfcal when error weighting in invert
              is enabled. I noticed that instead of checking for error
              weighting they checked for radial weighting.

05/17/94 addmod.c difmap.c edmodel.hlp

     Details: Wrote obedmod() function to edit the variable parts
              of the established and tentative models of an
              observation.

 New command: edmodel - Allows the user to edit the variable
              components of their model in an external editor.

05/17/94 model.c

     Details: Wrote edmod to edit models with an external editor.
              Changed the return value of rmodel to an error indicator
              instead of the number of components read.
              Changed wmodel to have it write column headings for each
              parameter. Also tidied up the format and made it only
              write 6 significant digits per parameter since 32 bit
              floats only have this much precision.

05/16/94 scrfil_src/*

     Details: Separated misc file functions into a separate library.
              Wrote new ed_file() function to allow editing of files
              with an external editor.

05/11/94 model.c

     Details: wmodel now uses lprintf() instead of fprintf to write to
              the given stream. This means that when the model is written
              to stdout it is appropriately logged.

05/11/94 model.c

     Details: Model files that contain syntax errors now cause rmodel
              to terminate at the error rather than giving a warning,
              skipping the errant line and continuing. I did this after
              I realised what would happen if somebody accidentally gave
              it the name of a UV FITS file - ie. thousands of error messages.

05/10/94 model.c

     Details: Fixed a bug that sent rmodel into an infinite loop on lines
              having more than 7 fields. Also improved the sanity checking
              applied to input from model files. Comments (including inline
              comments) started with '!' are now explicitly recognised as
              such. Invalid input now evokes an error message and
              rejection of the offending line, instead of being quietly
              ignored.

05/09/94 vlbutil.h plbeam.c ellips.c ellips.h modplot.c mapplot.c mapwin.c
         help/mapplot.hlp

      Reason: Model components can be displayed symbolically in maplot.
              Up until now deltas were represented by + symbols and all
              other types by a small circular symbol. Greg suggested that
              the other components could be displayed by the outline of
              their elliptical aspects. I already had code to draw the
              elliptical clean beam, so I decided to generalize this to
              a set of generic ellipse manipulation functions.

     Details: Replaced ellips.c with a new more complete module, and added
              a new header file for it called ellips.h.
              Removed the BeamAspect descriptor and beam_aspect function
              from plbeam.c and vlbutil.h, and modified plbeam.c to use the
              new ellipse functions. Changed peakwin in mapwin.c to use
              the new ellipse functions rather than beam_aspect().
              Modified modplot.c to plot ellipses for elliptical components. 
              Modified maplot.c to use the modified version of plbeam().

05/07/94 besj.c

     Details: c_besj0 and c_besj1 both had a > where a < was required.
              This means that both uniform-disk and ring type model
              component have never been calculated properly. I doubt
              that anybody has ever used these types since difmap can't
              restore them, and the fact that they were wrong would have
              been obvious to anybody who tried them. My new c_besj2
              function also had a major bug in it, but this is only
              used in the modelfit code which has not officially been
              installed yet.

05/04/94 maplot.c wmapbeam.c

     Details: In calculating the map center RA and DEC I had entered
              the contributions from the east and northward shifts
              with the wrong sign. Now corrected.

05/04/94 maplot.c stnstr.c

     Details: The array description displayed in the title of maplot
              was written for VLBI in which each telescope is represented
              by a one or two letter abbreviation. With arrays such as
              the VLA maplot thus displayed 27 Ys, one for each telescope.
              Maplot calls stnstr() to get this description. I changed
              stnstr to first compose the description (per sub-array)
              using the abbreviation letters, and then to replace these
              with a recognised array name if all the stations were the
              same. Also changed the title to say "Array:" instead of
              "Stations ".

05/04/94 vlbhead.c

     Details: Under the poor assumption that the observation epoch was
              a Besselian epoch, I had prefixed the letter 'B' to the
              epoch year. I have removed this.

05/04/94 maplot.c hms.c

     Details: Steve Myers asked me to add the (possibly shifted) RA and
              DEC of the center of the map anotated in maplot. I have done
              this. While doing it I changed the sraddms() and sradhms()
              padding character, used to make the integral part of the
              seconds text up to 2 characters, to 0 instead of space.

05/03/94 uvradplt.c difmap.c

     Details: I have added two arguments to the radplt command to
              allow the specification of a fixed amplitude display
              range.

05/02/94 wmapbeam.c

     Details: I had assumed that BUNIT in the input UV FITS file
              would be changed during AIPS calibration to sensible
              units. I thus used the value of the BUNIT keyword
              in constructing the map FITS file BUNIT keyword. This
              turned out to be a bad assumption, and since AIPS MX
              and UVMAP both ignore BUNIT and simply hard-wire
              JY/BEAM in their output files, I have modified difmap
              to do the same.

05/02/94 wmapbeam.c

     Details: The map center was described in terms of the apparent
              RA, with no allowance for the effects of the shift
              command. It now writes out the map reference coordinates
              as the mean epoch RA,DEC and represents any shift in
              via the reference pixel.

04/26/94 mapres.c

     Details: When restoring guassians the convolved gaussians all
              appeared to have major axis position angles of 0.0
              degrees. This turned out to be due to an optimistic
              sanity check that said that if either of the arguments
              to antan2 were < 1.0e-10 then subsitute angle=0.0 for
              the atan2. I have changed this to only subsitute 0.0 if
              either of the arguments is exactly 0.0.

04/26/94 model.h model.c difmap.c mapclean.c

     Details: For model fitting a non-interactive method of specifying
              a model containing free parameters is needed. I have
              changed the model reader and writer to understand that
              parameters that are post-fixed with a 'v' or 'V' in a
              model file, are variable parameters. To record this info
              with each component I introduced an enumerated bitmap
              to specify which, if any, parameters of a component are
              variable.

04/23/94 startmod command in difmap.c, help/startmod.hlp help/selfcal.hlp

     Details: Steve Myers wanted to be able to supply a solution interval
              to startmod. Startmod is implemented in terms of selfcal
              so this was straight forward. Documented the new facility
              in startmod.hlp. Also noticed that selfcal.hlp incorrectly
              said that the solution interval only applied to amplitude
              corrections - now fixed.

04/21/94 uvaver.c

         Bug: Uvaver was calling select before preserving the established
              model. The select was then deleting the established model.
              Uvaver now preserves the model before the select call.

04/20/94 uvf_read.c

     Details: uvf_read.c would say that it was binning into 0 second
              integrations if no binning was requested. This would be
              bound to confuse people. It now only reports the bin
              size if non-zero.

04/20/94 uvradplt.c uvplot.c

     Details: Nick asked for the option of using larger graph markers.
              Both uvplot and radplot now provide the '.' key to toggle
              between the smallest possible marker and the next biggest.
              The former is still the default.

04/14/94 uvf_read.c intlist.h intlist.c visaver.h visaver.c

     Details: Completed uvf_read implementation of binning
              visibilities into integrations via vector averaging.
              uvf_read now collects groups into a dynamic list of
              integration bins for each sub-array. These groups are
              then vector averaged into their output integrations.

04/13/94 difmap_src/{obs.h uvf_write.c corplt.c maplot.c timplt.c uvaver.c
         uvf_read.c uvplot.c uvradplt.c visaver.c vplot.c vlbhead.c}

     Details: Decided to collect all observation reference-date related
              info into a structure called Obdate. The instance of this
              in the Observation structure is called ob->date. Thus what
              used to be ob->ut is now ob->date.ut.

04/12/94 difmap_src/{uvaver.c,visaver.c,visaver.h}

     Details: In preparation for changing uvf_read to bin data via
              vector averaging, I decoupled the averaging code from
              uvaver.c into a visaver object based set of method
              functions. Also made use of the new definition of ob->ut
              (see above) for the origin of the time grid.

04/12/94 difmap_src/uvf_read.c

     Details: Decided to change the reference UT to the start of the
              first day of the observation, rather than the exact time
              of the first integration. This can then be used as a
              reference time for solution bin time grids.

04/12/94 fits_src/fits.c

     Details: Channels above channel 33 of a spectral-line file
              appeared to be corrupt.

         Bug: Both get_data and put_data were using the size of the
              FITS data-type to increment the callers array pointer,
              instead of the size of an element of the caller's array.
              The problem came into play when the data being
              read/written consituted more than 200 elements (the size
              of the type-conversion buffer). In this case the
              caller's array was (double) and the FITS type was
              (float) so the array was incremented by half as much as
              it should have been (100 elements). 33 * (re,im,wt) == 99.

       Fixed: Added bsize variable to both effected functions,
              assigned with the user array element size and used this
              instead.

04/06/94 uvaver.c

     Details: New command to the UVF version of difmap, used to perform
              a weighted vector average of all data into time bins of
              given dimensions. It also optionally deduces new weights
              from the data scatter. This involves averaging the data
              into a new uvdata.scr file, and re-sizing the ob
              structure. Since U,V,W are shared between all
              visibilities on a given baseline within a given
              integration, the weighted mean U,V,W is deduced from
              weighting the mean by all visibilities using them.
              Time-stamps are not averaged since this would require
              two passes through the data to determine time-stamps and
              sort them before averaging visibilities.

04/06/94 obs.c

     Details: uvaver implementation requires Obs_alloc to allow
              re-allocation.

     Changes: Changed to make it only complain about re-allocation if
              the dimensions of ob->dp do not match the new
              dimensions. Also modified it to delete ob->uvp and
              ob->ifp if their dimensions do not match the new
              dimensions. Following this it now creates ob->uvp and/or
              ob->ifp, if NULL, with the new dimensions.

04/06/94 uvf_read.c wtscal.c

     Details: Discovered that it was legal to have AIPS WTSCAL < 0.
              Difmap substituted 1 if wtscal<=0, so good data with
              wtscal < 0 looked flagged and bad data looked good.
              To avoid many complications I have modified uvf_read.c
              to scale the data weights by the sign of wtscal on read
              in. The absolute magnitude of wtscal is defered for
              application by iniIF() as before. The sanity check for
              wtscal==0 is still performed and 1 substituted if true.

          NB: This problem turned up in relation to OVRO data in which
              weights are written with the opposite sign convention
              to AIPS, and then fixed up by making wtscal -ve.
              Nick's version of difmap needs to have this patch applied.

03/31/94 obs.h intrec.c uvf_read.c

     Details: Added intrec record number member to the Integration
              class. uvf_read now initializes this member for each
              integration and ini_Intrec sorts by it instead of by
              time-stamp. 

         Bug: Noticed that the existing implementation of ini_Intrec
              was not updating its record of the time-stamps for the
              sub-array nodes when an integration was transferred to
              ob->intrec. The effect (never observed by me, due to
              lack of appropriate test data) would be that ini_Intrec
              would fail if any sub-array overlapped any other
              sub-array in time. This would have produced no error
              messages but would have crashed difmap with a
              segmentation fault.

          NB: Nick's version of difmap needs to have this patch applied.
